## Cell Phone Providers

Coming to another country is filled with exciting places to see and people to talk
with about your adventures. Having a cell phone is important not only so you can update
your fellow students about your well being, but also to stay in touch with friends
and family back at home. If you are looking for cell service that works in the U.S.,
we recommend getting a domestic plan so you can stay in touch with your relatives
and friends at a cheaper cost, avoid expensive international fees for talk, text,
or web, and grants you access to service here in the U.S. easier and faster for internet
or other needs.

# To obtain a U.S. cell phone number, you can either:

* Purchase an unlocked phone and buy a U.S. sim card

OR

* Buy a new phone with a pre-paid "pay as you go" or a contract monthly plan

# Consider and research now what option will be right for you:

* Require any documents (Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification
  Number) or fees (deposit)
* Where you can buy an unlocked or new phone
* Plan provides international talk, text, or abroad access
* Download cheap/free overseas messaging apps (WhatsApp/Skype)
