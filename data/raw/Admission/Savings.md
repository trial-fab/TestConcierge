University life is a new change for students looking to learn and have exciting new
adventures from world-class professionals. The University of South Florida (USF) recongizes
that college is costly, especially for our international students. Our team wants
to inform you of ways to be a smart consumer and save while studying at USF.

### USFID Card

It is important for students to obtain a USFID Card, not only because it helps students
to gain access to their on campus housing, dining plan, and transportation, but also
to get additional free and discounted services by being a full-time college student.

The USFID Card can enable students to access discounts locally. Discounts can be offered
by verifying your student status on websites such as ID.me or Unidays, by showing
a participating location your USFID Card, or by selecting that you are a college student
for participating discounts.

### Flamingo Card

Students on each campus are able to ride public transportation throughout the Tampa
Bay area for free using their USFID to link with a Flamingo Card that can be picked
up from a campus Parking and Transportation Services office.

### Local Discounts

Student Government provides an annual update to their savings webpage linking students
to local businesses that offer discounted or free services for students to use with
their USFID Card.

### Uber Discounts

In addition, Student Government offers a discount to Uber services each month on a
