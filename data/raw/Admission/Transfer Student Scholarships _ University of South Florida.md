## Transfer Student Scholarships

College is expensive. That's why we offer generous scholarships and grants to help
high-achieving transfer students with their college expenses. Scholarships and grants
are forms of merit- or need-based aid that do not need to be repaid. Students can
qualify for scholarships and grants from USF, the USF Foundation, Bright Futures and
other organizations. Explore the kind of awards available, how to qualify and how
to apply.

### USF Admissions Scholarships

To increase your chances of qualifying for the maximum amount of admissions scholarships,
all you have to do is submit your complete admissions application. Scholarships are
available for both in-state and out-of-state students. If you receive a scholarship,
you will be notified in your acceptance letter.

million in privately funded scholarships each year.

or personal information to qualify you for scholarships. Information on potential
scholarships can be obtained through other reputable sources, at no cost to you. Please

about how to avoid scholarship and financial aid scams.
