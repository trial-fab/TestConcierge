## Non-Degree Seeking Students

![Non-degree seeking student using her laptop.](./Non-Degree _ University of South Florida_files/2021-adm-nds-cms-header.jpg)

At the University of South Florida, we strive to meet the needs of everyone who attends
our institution, including non-degree-seeking students. Whether you want to take classes
to satisfy a personal interest, fulfill admission requirements, earn college credits
or learn a new skill, we offer convenient options for you.

### Transient Students

I am attending another public Florida institution. I am interested in taking additional
courses at USF to count toward my degree at my home institution, to meet an admission
requirement for another degree program or to satisfy a personal interest or desire
for enrichment.

[Get More Transient Student Info](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/non-degree-admission/transient_students.aspx#Transient-Students)

### Visiting Students

I am attending an institution that is not a public Florida institution. I am interested
in taking additional courses at USF to count toward my degree at my home institution,
to meet an admission requirement for another degree program or to satisfy a personal
interest or desire for enrichment.

[Info on Being a Visiting Student](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/non-degree-admission/transient_students.aspx#Visiting-Students)

---

### Personal Enrichment/Interest Students Or Post-Graduates Preparing for Next Degree

I am not currently enrolled at a college or university and am interested in taking
courses as an admission requirement for entry into a degree program, for personal
interest or to earn college credit.

**Please note:** this is not recommended for degree-seeking freshman or transfer students who do not
meet general admission criteria to USF.

[Get More Information on These Courses](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/non-degree-admission/personal-enrichment-students.aspx)

### Dual Enrollment Students

I am a high school or home-schooled student who has not yet graduated. I am interested
in taking college courses at USF to earn both high school and college credit.

[I Want Dual Enrollment Info](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/non-degree-admission/dual-enrollment-students.aspx)

### Senior Auditors

I am a Florida resident 60 years of age or older. I am interested in taking classes
for personal enrichment only and not to earn college credit or grades.

[See More About Senior Audits](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/non-degree-admission/senior-citizen-audit.aspx)

### Certificate Students

I have earned at least a bachelor’s degree, which is required for most graduate certificate
programs. I will use a graduate certificate to supplement my current graduate program
of study or to enhance my skills in a related field.
