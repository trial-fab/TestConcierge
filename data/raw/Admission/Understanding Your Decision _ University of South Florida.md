## Understanding Your Decision

![USF student in a green shirt sitting at a table and using her laptop.](./Understanding Your Decision _ University of South Florida_files/adm-design-outreach-and-access-cms-header-programs.png)

Receiving an admission decision is an exciting time for many students, but we know
it can be confusing, too. Admission to the University of South Florida is very competitive,
and we make decisions carefully to ensure every student has the best chance of success.
If you were admitted to a USF campus, program or term you didn't originally apply
to, it's because we believe this will give you the best start to your life as a Bull.

### Spring 2026 Applicants

If you've applied to USF for the Spring 2026 term, you can check your application
status, submit documents and receive important updates in our [Legacy Applicant Portal](http://admissions.usf.edu/applicant-portal).

### I Haven't Received My Decision Yet

We know it can be frustrating to wait longer than you expected for an admission decision.
Your academic future is important to you and it's equally important to us, so we dedicate
time to reviewing your application and making the decision that will ensure your success.
There could be several reasons why you haven't received a decision yet:

#### We Need More Information From You

Sometimes, we need additional information, such as updated test scores, in order to
make a decision about your application. If you receive an email from us requesting
more information from you, make sure to follow the instructions to submit your new
information as soon as possible to account for processing time.

#### Your Decision is on the Way

If your [Applicant Portal](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status) doesn't indicate that you need to submit new information, and you submitted your
application by the deadline, you may need to wait a few days for your decision. A
high volume of applications can increase processing times, especially because we complete
a careful and thorough review of every application we receive.

### Did I Receive an Admissions Scholarship?

Merit-based scholarships add to the excitement of receiving an admission decision,
and we know many students are eager to find out if they've been awarded an admissions
scholarship. This year, students will be notified of their scholarship status in their
acceptance letters. However, scholarship information may become available sooner in
your Student Self-Service portal.

In the meantime, ensure you can be awarded other types of financial aid by completing
your FAFSA.

### I Was Admitted to a Different Term

You applied for the fall semester, but you were admitted to summer or spring. While
you might have to change your plans, you can make the most of your first term here
at USF.

#### I Was Admitted to the Summer B Term

If you were admitted to Summer B, we think you'd be a great fit for our six-week summer
session **starting on June 30, 2025**.

In the Summer B session, you'll get a head start on your journey as a USF Bull. This
is a common start term for freshmen students, so you'll be surrounded by other new
Bulls as you get used to campus life ahead of the busy fall semester.

Most incoming students who start in the Summer B session will take two in-person classes
(or six credit hours), so it's important to get started on your next steps soon, including
applying for on-campus housing.

[Summer B Next Steps Checklist](https://364394.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/364394/adm_next-steps-guide_summer-b-2025_downloadable_8.5x11_digital_final.pdf)

#### I Was Admitted to the **Virtual Summer Session** (Summer D)

If you were admitted to Summer D, or our Virtual Summer Session, we think you have
the best chance of success by completing our three-week summer session starting on
**July 14, 2025.**

The Virtual Summer Session is an opportunity for incoming freshmen to complete online
coursework and build friendships with your peers.

If the Virtual Summer Session schedule doesn't work for you, you can opt to enroll
in Spring 2026.

#### I Was Admitted to the Spring Term

If you were admitted to Spring 2026, you'll get to start life as a USF Bull on **January 12, 2026.** The spring term is lively and active on all three USF campuses, so you'll have many
opportunities to get involved in clubs and organizations as soon as you arrive!

### I Was Admitted to the Student Support Services (SSS) Program

Student Support Services, or SSS, is a program that provides academic and personal
support for a selected group of students. As part of it, you'll receive personalized
coaching, enhance your study skills and make friends with other students.

If you were admitted through the SSS program, participation is mandatory. Learn more
about the benefits of the SSS program:

[Student Support Services Program](https://www.usf.edu/undergrad/sss/index.aspx)

### I Was Admitted to a Different USF Campus

We know it might be confusing to learn you were admitted to a different campus than
the one you applied to. Review our campus assignment page to learn more about campus
assignments, including requirements, options and frequently asked questions.

*Note: You may have the option to change campuses after your first semester. If you
do want to change campuses, discuss it with your academic advisor so you can work
together to determine if it's the best option for you.*

[Campus Assignment](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

#### I Was Admitted to the USF St. Petersburg Campus

Congratulations! USF St. Petersburg is our waterfront campus in the heart of vibrant
downtown St. Petersburg. At USF St. Petersburg, you'll get to enjoy your college experience
in a location all your friends will envy.

[Learn More About USF St. Petersburg](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/why-usf/our-campuses/#StPete)

#### I Was Admitted to the USF Sarasota-Manatee Campus

Congratulations! USF Sarasota-Manatee will give you a personalized learning environment
just steps from the Sarasota Bay. USF Sarasota-Manatee is our smallest campus and
has a tight-knit community where it's easy to get involved and forge new friendships.

### I Was Denied Admission to USF

Admission to USF is highly competitive, but denied students have options like appealing
their decision or participating in pathway programs.

[Denied Admission and Appeals Process](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/contact-us/appeals-process.aspx)

---

### My Decision Was Rescinded

As stated on the application for admission, USF reserves the right to rescind your
offer of admission based on any changes to your academic or student conduct record.

Your admission to the University of South Florida may be rescinded for several reasons.
Common causes include:

* **Missing Final High School Transcript:** The Office of Admissions has not received your official final high school transcript.
  The Florida Board of Governors requires all first-time-in-college students to submit
  a final transcript verifying graduation before enrolling at any State University System
  institution in Florida. If you provide an official transcript to the Office of Admissions,
  your admission may be reinstated.
* **Transcript Discrepancies:** Your final high school transcript does not match the STARS (*formerly SSAR/SRAR*) you submitted when you applied.
* **Unmet GPA Requirements:** Your final cumulative GPA no longer meets USF’s admission standards.
* **Senior Year Academic Decline:** You failed a course or experienced a significant drop in performance during your senior
  year (e.g., multiple C’s, D’s, or F’s).
* **Canceled Standardized Test Scores:** Your test scores were canceled by the College Board (SAT), ACT, or CLT resulting in
  you no longer meeting USF’s admission standards.
* **Postsecondary Coursework Issues:** You failed to disclose dual enrollment or other college coursework, your postsecondary
  GPA is below 2.5 or you earned poor grades in those courses.

Students who have had their admission rescinded after a term has started **may** be allowed to complete that term at the discretion of the University. However, they
will not be allowed to enroll in future terms unless they reapply for admission to
USF.

**Appeals and Financial Aid Notice**

If your admission is rescinded, you will have **10 days** to appeal the decision.

If your appeal is denied **after** financial aid has been disbursed, your aid will be canceled, and **you will be responsible for repaying those funds**.  Questions regarding your financial aid can be directed to the Financial Aid Office
at USF by calling (813) 974-4700.

If you have a housing or meal plan, please ensure that both have been canceled.
