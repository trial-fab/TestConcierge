## Funding College

As a student at the University of South Florida (USF), you may be looking for additional
ways to fund your education and experiences studying abroad or you may face unique
financial challenges. There are a variety of resources and strategies available to
help you succeed financially throughout your time here.

### Funding Opportunities

When it comes to these types of funding opportunities, students typically will need
to self-research available choices that are eligible. To give students an idea of
where to look for types of funding, a student can look:

* At scholarship, grants, or financial aid opportunities through your admitted college,
  department or program for both undergraduate and graduate students.
* Departments may assist students to seek funding channels, such as the [Office of National Scholars](https://www.usf.edu/ons/) connecting students with competitive national scholarship information.
* Undergraduate students in the [Honor's College](https://www.usf.edu/honors/) have the opportunity to complete requirements for additional funding
* Graduate students can contact their [Graduate Advsior/Contact/Director](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/students/graduate/graduate-advising.aspx) for available Graduate Assistantships/Teaching/Research (GA/TA/RA) employment.
* Students eligible based on their visa-type may seek student employement opportunities
  on campus for OPS positions to help with day-to-day costs.
* Students may seek additional funding externally from USF from educational or governmental
  institutions from their home country or in the United States depending on the student's
  elgibility and funding resource.\*

*\* It is important to also check the legitmacy of external funding opportunities, as
they may be host to scams. For instance, a common one is seen in USF email inboxes
about employement/funding opportunities by foundations such as "Skoll" that promise
high-monteary weekly rewards at unrealistic standards.*

### Financial Aid

[Office of Financial Aid](https://www.usf.edu/financial-aid/) is the go-to office for any and all questions concerning economic assistance and
information where to find different types of funding opportunities. The Office of
Financial Aid also hosts AwardSpring, a scholarship-based platform you fill out an
application to match to potential scholarships you can apply for funding.

Financial aid comes in different shapes and sizes and is not garunteed. Aid primarily
concerns international students through grants, scholarships, loans, and student employment.
