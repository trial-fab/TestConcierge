## Transfer Transcript Submission

![USF student sitting at a table reading a book.](./Transfer Transcript Submission _ USF Office of Admissions_files/adm-cms-transcript-headers-2.jpg)

Students attending USF as an incoming transfer must submit transcripts to enroll at
the university. Below are definitions of the types of transcripts that may be requested
and how to complete the requirement.

---

### REQUIRED FOR:

#### **Complete Application**

You must submit **official transcripts for** **any school or institution attended** to help complete your application to receive an admissions decision. Please check
the [Applicant Portal](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status) for details on your specific transcripts requested.

If you attended multiple institutions, be sure to submit separate official transcripts
from each of them.

#### Final Enrollment at USF

Before enrolling at USF, you must submit your **final official transcripts from your last institution.** Failure to do so before your first day of classes may result in a hold on your student
account, potentially affecting financial aid and future registration. Your admission
offer is contingent on receiving and evaluating your transcript.

---

### **HOW TO SUBMIT OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS**

Incoming students should submit final transcripts electronically, using the University
of South Florida's school code **001537**. Follow the outlined options below for submission based on your school type.

Important notes for transcript submission:

* Transcripts must be sent directly to USF from your school.
* Provide official final transcripts from all post-secondary institutions attended.
* Allow 4-6 weeks for the USF Office of Admissions to process your transcript.
* Do NOT fax your transcripts to USF.
* If you cannot submit digitally, we will accept hard copies via mail.
  + Hard copy official transcripts should be sent directly from the school in sealed envelopes.
    If you bring your own transcript to a USF campus, ensure it remains sealed; opening
    it renders it unofficial.
