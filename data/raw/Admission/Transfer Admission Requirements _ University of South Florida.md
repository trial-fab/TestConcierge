### Priority Admission Consideration

Transfer applicants who have received an Associate of Arts (A.A.) degree from a Florida
public institution immediately prior to transferring receive **priority consideration** for transfer admissions to USF, provided the transfer application and all required
application materials are received by the Office of Admissions by the transfer deadline.
Applicants applying for Selective Majors must meet [additional requirements](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/transfer/admission-information/major-requirements.aspx) for their intended major.

**Note**: All high school students, including those earning an A.A. degree through Dual Enrollment,
must submit a Freshman (First-Year) application to USF by the Freshman deadline. For
more information about applying as a Freshman with a Florida A.A. degree, please click
[here](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/academic-requirements.aspx).

### Additional Requirements for Selective Majors

Students must meet the minimums based on student type, but also must meet additional
requirements, such as:

* Prerequisites
* Higher GPA
* Audition
* Portfolio
* Any other supplemental materials

Therefore, even if you meet the general requirements, your admission to specific academic
programs may depend on meeting these. Please look at your intended academic college
and major to see if there are any additional requirements needed for admission.

[Selective Major Requirements](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/transfer/admission-information/major-requirements.aspx)

Additional requirements are also outlined in [the Undergraduate Catalog](https://catalog.usf.edu/).

**What if I'm fluent in another language?**

To be considered for admission to USF, students are required to have completed two
units (years) of instruction in a foreign language. However, you may document proficiency
in a second language to meet this requirement.

In Florida, the course number that is designated to indicate a foreign language waiver
is 0791920 with the course title "Bright Futures Foreign Language Proficiency Waiver."
For a list of ways to document proficiency in a second language in order to qualify
for a foreign language waiver, refer to the [Florida Counseling for Future Education Handbook](https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/5421/urlt/FCFFEH.pdf).

If you meet the waiver requirements, we encourage you to work with your guidance counselor
to document the waiver on your transcript or via a letter to the Office of Admissions.

[Show Does USF have an Essay Requirement?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/transfer/admission-information/academic-requirements.aspx)

No. We do not request an essay or personal statement to be evaluated for admission
to USF. Any essay or personal statement that you submit will not be opened or reviewed.

[Show What if I completed Dual Enrollment courses?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/transfer/admission-information/academic-requirements.aspx)

All high school students, including those earning an A.A. degree through Dual Enrollment,
must submit a [freshman (first-year) application](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/academic-requirements.aspx) to USF by the freshman deadline. **They are not considered transfer students.** Only students who have earned 12 or more credits ***post***-high school graduation are considered transfer students.
