## Health and Insurance

All international students are required to enroll in health insurance upon beginning
school. Students have the option to enroll in the USF-sponsored health insurance plan
OR obtain an alternative policy that complies with the universitys insurance coverage
requirements before the posted deadline.

### Medical and Immunization requirements

All students must provide proof of immunization requirements to be in compliance with
the USF Student Health & Wellness Center and the state of Florida.

These requirements include:

* Mandatory: Two Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccines or a blood titer test received within
  five years of the student’s program start date, showing immunity to measles and rubella.
* Mandatory (for all students who use an international address at the time of application): Tuberculosis
  screening (Skin test or blood test via T-Spot or QFT) completed within 6 months prior
  to the 1st semester that students physically attend classes on any of the USF campuses.
* Recommended but Voluntary: Three Hepatitis B vaccines or formally declining this immunization via the Student
  Self-Service account or on the Medical History and Immunization Form.
* Recommended but Voluntary: Proof of a meningitis vaccine (after the student's 16th birthday), or formally declining
  this immunization via the Student Self-Service account or via the Medical History
  and Immunization Form

#### Resources to Help Students Complete Their USF Immunization Requirements

The Student Health & Wellness Center’s team updates their website each semester to
reflect important dates and deadlines relevant to the upcoming semester. Students
can find more information about their [health insurance requirements here](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/student-health-services/insurance/).

* Students may use the [Medical History and Immunization Form](https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/safelinks/1/atp-safelinks.html) to submit proof of their requirements. This form requires formal authorization from
  a healthcare provider, so students should make sure to leave enough time to complete
  this task for their enrollment.
* Students may also visit the [Student Health Services website](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/student-health-services/immunizations/) for more information on their USF immunization requirements.
* For questions about USF health insurance requirements, students may send their inquiries
  directly to [Student Health Services.here.](https://www.jotform.com/form/212995896332167.)

*Students are not permitted to register for courses until their completed Medical History
and Immunizations Form has been received by USF Health Services, so be sure to submit
it in a timely fashion.*

**Please note:** This form requires formal authorization from a healthcare provider, so please ensure
to leave time to complete this task for enrollment.

#### Insurance Holds

The insurance or ‘SI Hold’ is placed on international students’ accounts, reminding
them to indicate their preferred choice for an acceptable health insurance plan. In
order to remove the SI Hold, students must submit their **Student Health Insurance Agreement** before the semester begins.

A registration hold will be placed on students’ accounts if they do not complete this
insurance agreement, and this will prevent them from signing up for their classes.
