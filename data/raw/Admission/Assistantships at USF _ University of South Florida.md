## Assistantships at USF

Many colleges and departments at USF employ students as graduate assistants on a competitive
basis to teach (TA), conduct research (RA), or carry out other relevant tasks that
contribute to the student's professional development (GA). The number of positions
available is based on funding from the university and grants awarded to faculty.

### Eligibility Requirements

To receive an assistantship, the graduate student must meet the following eligibility
requirements:

* Accepted into a graduate degree program and meet the qualifications as specified by
  the graduate program
* Meet the academic qualifications as specified by the GA job code
* Meet appropriate verbal test scores if English in not the primary language
* Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) and degree program GPA of 3.00
* Enroll full-time during the semester(s) appointed as a graduate assistant. Full-time
  enrollment is considered 9 graduate credit hours in the fall semester, 9 graduate
  credit hours in the spring semester, and 6 graduate credit hours in the summer semester.
  If a graduate assistant is enrolled in the last semester of his/her program of study,
  the number of registered semester hours may be less than the full-time requirement.
* Graduate assistants must comply with all Office of Graduate Studies enrollment requirements
  to retain their assistantship as stated in the Polices section of the Office of Graduate
  Studies Catalog
* Students appointed with <0.25 total FTE are not eligible for tuition waivers

Contact the graduate program director in your department of interest for more information.
