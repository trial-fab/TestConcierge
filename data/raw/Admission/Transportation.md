The University of South Florida (USF) campuses are located in differing environments
and urban locations. Transportation on and off campus are important for getting to
housing off campus, getting essential items, or even exploring the wider-region as
a whole. Each campus contains unique options for students to explore off campus and
the Tampa Bay area as a whole.

### Tampa

The USF Tampa campus is located north of Tampa near the University-neighborhood area.
Fowler and Fletcher Avenue line the botton and top of campus, respectively. Bruce
B Down Blvd and 50th Street North line the university campus vertically. Most common
tranportation options around USF Tampa include cars, buses, or micromobility.

### Micromobility

Students may think about purchaing micromobility for their use throughout their 2-4
years at USF. Micromobility are personal transportation options such as bikes, scooters,
skateboards, etc. Micromobility is a faster option in some cases to get both on and
off campus easily and get to destinations the fasest from pedestrian paths. From the
center of campus, the shortest route to off campus is around is around 0.7 kilometers
(0.43 miles) and the longest 1.39 kilometers (0.86 miles). Campus is a large rectangle
with the hortizontal width approximately 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) and vertically
1.6 kilometers (1 mile).

You should consider which option may be most practical for you for commuting, personal
leisure, or transportation. Considerations can include if it is electric, you cannot
bring it inside on-campus housing because of the fire risk, safety lights/reflectors
to be seen during the day or night, or short or longer commutes. You can look to purchase
any options from local stores, big box stores (Walmart, Target, etc.), online from
marketplaces or a company's website.

### Bus

Students on the USF Tampa campus have access to the Bull Runner, a dedicated bus service
that goes both on and off campus to the north, west, and south. The Bull Runner has
six unique routes to get you anyhwere on campus.

Students may also consider using the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit (HART) bus
system to get to campus. More information can be found on our transportation tab in
Living in Tampa Bay.

### Car

Students who have a valid driver's license can obtain or rent a car from on and off
campus transportation. Cars can be purchased if students have the funds from local
car dealerships (new or used) or rented from the two ZipCar locations (near the MSC
