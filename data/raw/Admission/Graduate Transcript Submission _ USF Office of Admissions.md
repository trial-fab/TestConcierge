## Graduate Transcript Submission

![USF graduate student reading a book.](./Graduate Transcript Submission _ USF Office of Admissions_files/adm-cms-submit-transcripts4.jpg)

Before registration for a second semester is permitted, USF must receive official transcripts which document that the required degree was completed prior to the start of graduate study
at USF. During the first semester, the Office of Admissions will place a registration
hold on the student’s file pending receipt of the official transcripts.

Submit official transcripts of all bachelor’s and/or master’s transcripts and any other transcript with graduate work directly to the Office of
Admissions (Student Services Building, SVC1036) or electronically. If you submit international transcripts, you must also include English translations and a course-by-course Foreign Credential Evaluation from a Credential Evaluation Service.

The University of South Florida (School Code 001537) will accept electronic transcripts
as official if they are submitted through one of the following providers:

**Electronic Services Providers**

* **FASTER/SPEEDE**\*
* [Parchment Exchange](https://exchange.parchment.com/) (including Naviance and Credential Solutions)
* [National Student Clearinghouse](http://www.studentclearinghouse.org/)
* [Credential Solutions](https://www.parchment.com/)
* [Scribbles Software](http://scribsoft.com/)
* [AARTS and SMART transcripts](https://jst.doded.mil/official.html) (military service only, not required for admission)
* [SCOIR](https://www.scoir.com/)

 \* FASTER and SPEEDE/ExPRESS are sets of predefined data formats used by educational
institutions to electronically exchange student records and transcripts. Institutions
must subscribe to the FASTER and/or SPEEDE/ExPRESS systems to participate in this
exchange.

**Please note:** Hard copies of official transcripts must be submitted in a sealed envelope directly
from the institution. If you pick up your official transcript and bring it to the
admissions office at any USF campus, make sure that the envelope has not been opened.
Once opened, the transcript is no longer considered official.
