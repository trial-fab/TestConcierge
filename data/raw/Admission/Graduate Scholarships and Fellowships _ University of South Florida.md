## Graduate Scholarships and Fellowships

Graduate school is expensive. Fortunately, there are many ways to earn scholarships
and fellowships, which don’t need to be repaid. Learn more about the kinds of awards
available, if you qualify and how to apply.

### USF Scholarships

Explore the AwardSpring scholarship database for USF awards you may wish to apply
for. Another scholarship source is the USF Foundation, which awards over $5 million
in free privately funded scholarships each year. The Office of Graduate Studies also
offers fellowship opportunities for new and continuing graduate students.

* [Office of Graduate Studies](https://www.usf.edu/graduate-studies/)

### Graduate Fellowships

In addition to graduate assistantships and scholarships, USF also offers fellowship
opportunities. This funding helps decrease the cost of attendance without associated
teaching or research responsibilities.

### Fulbright Scholarships

The Fulbright U.S. Student Program is the largest exchange program in the United States,
providing students and young professionals with opportunities to pursue international
graduate study, advanced research, university teaching and primary and secondary school
teaching in over 155 countries. Nearly 1,600 Fulbright grants are awarded each year
in a wide range of fields: government, higher education, business and industry, journalism
and more.

### Office of National Scholars

The ONS provides guidance and support for USF’s creative, motivated and academically
strong students as they compete for national merit scholarships across all disciplines.
They identify, recruit and mentor students who apply for prestigious scholarships
and work with faculty members to recruit candidates, write strong letters of recommendation,
review applications and essays and provide mock interviews for applicants.

### SCHOLARSHIP AND FINANCIAL AID SCAMS

Beware of any scholarship service or emails you receive requesting your bank account
or personal information to qualify you for scholarships. Information on potential
scholarships can be obtained through other reputable sources, at no cost to you. Please
visit the Federal Student Aid and Federal Trade Commission websites to learn more
about how to avoid scholarship and financial aid scams.
