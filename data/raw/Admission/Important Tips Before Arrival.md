## Important Tips Before Arrival

International students are advised to review the guidance below when traveling to
the United States.

* International students must not arrive to the United States more than 30 days prior
  to the start date set on their I-20.
* International students’ arrival must fall within the effective and valid dates indicated
  on their visa stamp.
* International students must arrive in time to participate in their required orientations.
* International students must go through immigration and customs at their first port
  of entry in the United States, and this may be time-consuming. For this reason, students
  are advised to allow 3-4 hours between connecting flights if they have not scheduled
  a direct flight to Tampa.

### Checking into on- and off-campus housing

# USF offices are open Monday through Friday and normal business hours are traditionally 8am-5pm (Eastern Standard Timezone; EST).

Students traveling to USF on the weekend (Saturday or Sunday) or after 5pm on a weekday
will need to make prior arrangements because they may not be able to move into their
on-campus housing accommodations.

Off-campus apartments may also have specific days and times in which students can
move into their accommodations. For this reason, students are encouraged to learn
the hours of operations of their off-campus apartments before arriving to Tampa, St.
Petersburg, or Sarasota-Manatee.

### For Students Arriving to USF on the Weekends and/or After-Hours

Many students make hotel reservations in advance when traveling to Tampa, St. Petersburg,
and Sarasota-Manatee on the weekends or after-hours. Some students also choose to
stay with friends or family members located in or near a USF campus.
