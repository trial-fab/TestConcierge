## Admitted Graduate Student Checklist

Congratulations on your acceptance to one of the most prominent research universities
in the U.S.! Ready to get started on the transition to USF? Here are your next steps.

1. **Activate Your NetID and USF email address**

If you haven’t already, [activate your NetID](https://netid.usf.edu/ "activate your NetID") and USF email address (it will be used by all university offices for official communication).

2. **Verify Your Contact Information**

* [Sign in to Student Self-Service](https://my.usf.edu/)
* Navigate to “Student Record"
* Click on "View & Update My Information"
* Select "Personal Information"
* Verify that your address, telephone number and email addresses are current
* Check your [residency status](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/graduate/admission-information/residency-information.aspx) to ensure you are charged the correct tuition rate

  3.  **Submit the FAFSA**

Need financial aid? Remember to [submit your FAFSA](https://www.usf.edu/financial-aid/apply/) to be considered for the most types of aid possible.

4. **Explore USF Scholarships**

Check out [additional scholarship opportunities](https://www.usf.edu/financial-aid/scholarships/index.aspx) offered by USF. Learn more about graduate fellowships at [grad.usf.edu/scholarships](https://www.usf.edu/graduate-studies/funding/fellowships-scholarships/).

  5**. Submit Final Transcripts and Test Scores**

Official transcripts documenting that the required degree was completed prior to the
start of graduate study at USF must be received before a second semester registration
is permitted. During the first semester, the Office of Admissions will place a registration
hold on the student’s file pending receipt of the official transcripts.  Submit official
transcripts of all bachelors and/or masters transcripts and any other transcript with
graduate work (including translations and evaluations for international transcripts)
directly to the Office of Admissions (Student Services Building, SVC1036) or electronically.

Official test scores, such as, GRE or GMAT, should be sent to USF from the testing
center (refer to Test Scores section of the graduate catalog).

6. **Connect with Your Graduate Program**

Some graduate programs or departments require enrollment confirmation, additional
information, or your attendance at a special orientation session to secure a place
in the program. In some cases, there is a strict deadline for these, so contact your
program to get further instructions and learn about registering for courses.

[USF Office of Graduate Studies Graduate Majors Contact List](http://grad.usf.edu/programs/search_all "USF Office of Graduate Studies Graduate Majors Contact List ")

7. **View the Graduate Student Life Guide**

Our [Graduate Student Life Guide](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/364394/campaigns/admissions/graduate/publications/2020.08.00.1-ADM-Grad%20Student%20Guide.pdf "Graduate Student Life Guide") can help you get acquainted with USF’s campus offerings for graduate students.

8. **Register for Orientation**

The Office of Graduate Studies provides an orientation program to welcome and inform
new students. This is an opportunity to learn about university services, academic
resources, policies and procedures, departmental information and campus organizations.

[Office of Graduate Studies’ Orientation Page](https://www.usf.edu/graduate-studies/students/newly-admitted-students/orientation/ "Office of Graduate Studies’ Orientation Page")

Your department or college also may require you to attend a department or orientation
session that they sponsor. Please consult your program for details.

9. **Submit Your Medical History**

Download and complete USF’s mandatory [medical history form](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/student-health-services/immunizations/immuncompliance.aspx). Upload to the [application portal](https://secure.vzcollegeapp.com/usf/).

If you have an [Immunization Hold](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/student-health-services/holds/index.aspx), you will need to take care of this before you can register for your first classes.

10. ****File Required Documentation (International Students Only)****[International Services](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-services/index.aspx) can assist you with your Visa and I-20 concerns.
