## Residency Information for Freshmen

![Group of four USF students in a dorm room taking a photo after submitting their residency information.](./Residency Information for Freshmen _ University of South Florida_files/adm_residency-cms-header_freshmen.png)
Residency refers to whether you are an in-state Florida resident or an out-of-state
resident based on [Florida state statute Section 1009.21](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=1000-1099/1009/Sections/1009.21.html). This classification is important because it determines your [tuition rate](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/cost-of-attendance/).

### Residency Determination

When you apply to USF, the Office of Admissions will determine your residency status
based on the information on your application.

**If we do not receive enough information to determine your residency, you will be classified
as a non-Florida resident for tuition purposes.**Florida residency does not impact your admission decision, only your tuition rate.

Respond to any requests for residency information as soon as possible.

### What does It mean to be an in-state resident?

If you're seeking in-state status, you must prove that you have established and maintained
legal Florida residence at least 12 months and one day before [the first day of classes](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/calendars/index.aspx) of your first semester (or the semester for which you're seeking in-state status)*.*

In-state status is only for permanent, legal residents of Florida, who don't have
established ties to another state. If you have an out-of-state permanent address on
your records, this can result in an out-of-state classification because it indicates
ties to another state. Please note that living in or attending school in Florida will
not, in itself, establish legal residence for tuition purposes.

### How do I qualify for florida residency?

First, you'll need to determine whether you're considered [dependent](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/dependent-status.aspx) or [independent](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/independent-status.aspx). If neither of these apply to you, you may qualify for an [exception](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/exceptions.aspx).

### For residency purposes, a student is considered:

**DEPENDENT** if:

* Under the age of 24 **and**not a graduate student

If you are a dependent, you will need to submit your **parent/guardian's** information.

 **INDEPENDENT** if:

* Age 24 or older, **or**;
* A graduate student, **or**;
* Under the age of 24 and can claim independence by the proof of a marriage license,
  proof of a dependent or proof of financial independence

If you are independent, you will need to submit **your own** information.

### HOW TO SUBMIT RESIDENCY DOCUMENTATION

To prove Florida residency, you need two documents proving you (if independent) or
your parent/guardian (dependent) lived in the state for at least [12 months and one day before your term starts](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/residency-information.aspx#residency_dates).

We highly encourage students to submit this information when applying to the university
but you can update this information afterwards via the [Residency Declaration Form on the Applicant Portal.](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status)

#### Step 1: Gather Your Residency Documentation

Whether you're applying for residency during your USF Application or in the Applicant
Portal, you'll need to submit **two** documents to prove that either you or your parent/guardian were a Florida resident
for at least 12 months and one day before first day of class.

* **If you are classified as a dependent:** Submit your parent/guardian's information.
* **If you are classified as an independent:** Submit your personal information.

You can find more information about dependent and independent status [on this page](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/residency/independent_dependent.aspx).

##### **What Documents Are Required to Prove Florida Residency Status?**

To prove your Florida residency, you **must** submit one document from Section A and then one more document either from Section
A or Section B.

**Please note:** Most people will end up submitting two documents from Section A.

Acceptable Documents for Florida Residency

| Section A | Section B |
| --- | --- |
| Florida driver's license   * Provide license number, original issue date and current issue date | Declaration of domicile in Florida   * This is a form you or your parent/guardian fills out declaring your place of residence,   and you can get the form from your county clerk's office |
| Florida voter's registration card   * Provide the number and issue date | Florida professional or occupational license   * You or your parent/guardian can get one of these licenses from the state of Florida   if they're applicable to a field you work in, like tree trimming or electrical |
| State of Florida identification card   * Provide the number, original issue date and current issue date | Florida incorporation   * If you or your parent has started a business in Florida, you can use this documentation   to prove residency |
| Florida vehicle registration   * Provide your VIN, original issue date and current issue date | Document evidencing family ties in Florida   * Submit a document signed by a relative who has lived in Florida for 12 months consecutively   and can provide documentation to prove their Florida residency |
| Proof of a permanent home in Florida occupied for 12 consecutive months   * Provide a deed, homeowner's policy, property tax payment or a lease with proof of   12 months payment | Proof of membership in a Florida-based charitable or professional organization   * Provide documentation that you or your parent/guardian is part of a professional or   charitable organization in Florida |
| Proof of permanent full-time employment in Florida for at least 30 hours per week over a 12-month period   * Provide W2 or pay stubs, as well as an official letter from your employer on company   letterhead that includes your start date, amount of hours worked, and employment duration | Any other documentation supporting your request for resident status, like utility bills and proof of 12 consecutive payments, a lease agreement with proof of 12 consecutive payments, or an official state, federal, or court document showing legal ties to Florida |
| Transcripts from a Florida high school that show two or more years if the Florida high school diploma was earned within the last 12 months |  |

***Note:*** If you or your parent/guardian have [proof of a homestead exemption in Florida](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/residency-information.aspx#homestead), you may now qualify for Florida residency through an exception using only this documentation.

Remember, if you're seeking in-state residency, you have to prove you've lived in
Florida for 12 months and one day before the start of your first semester. This means
your documents should be dated or include an issue date of 12 months and one day before
the first day of the semester.

* For example, if you want to start in the fall 2025 semester, which starts on *August 25, 2025*, you **must** have documentation that proves Florida residency dated before *August 24, 2024.*

| Term Starts | Latest Date Your Documents Can Show |
| --- | --- |
| Spring 2025: January 13, 2025 | January 12, 2024 |
| Summer B 2025: June 30, 2025 | June 29, 2024 |
| Summer D 2025: July 14, 2025 | July 13, 2024 |
| Fall 2025: August 25, 2025 | August 24, 2024 |
| Spring 2026: January 12, 2026 | January 11, 2026 |

#### Step 2: Submit a USF Application and Complete the Residency Section Completely ***OR*** Complete the Residency Declaration Form in the Applicant Portal

##### In Your Application

No matter which platform you use to submit your application – [USF Institution Application](https://admissions.usf.edu/application) or the [Common App](https://www.commonapp.org/) – simply follow the prompts to **submit the USF residency documents with your application.**The benefits of submitting your residency documents with your application are:

* It immediately starts your evaluation process.
* It prevents a delay in processing your application, which can impact available aid,
  housing and more.

*Please note:* Residency status does NOT affect your admission decision.

##### In the Applicant Portal

If you're declaring your residency after you've submitted your application, you'll
want to do that in the [Applicant Portal](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status).

1. You will be taken to your Admissions Checklist.
2. Select “Forms“ on your checklist.
3. Navigate to the Undergraduate Residency Declaration Form and follow the prompts to
   submit your documents.

*Please note:* Update(s) to your Application Checklist will not be reflected on your Applicant Portal
until your form is processed by the Office of Admissions. Please allow up to 4-6 weeks
for processing from the time the form is received.

#### Step 3: Know Your Residency Status

Once your Florida Residency for Tuition purposes status is approved, you will receive
a notification in your [Applicant Portal](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status) that this step has been completed. You are able to **register for classes** even if your residency status is not solidified.

* You have until the last day of classes in your first term to [request a re-evaluation of your initial residency status](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/freshmen-forms.aspx) by providing sufficient documentation. However, if your residency status is listed
  as non-Florida at the time that classes begin, you will be assessed out-of-state tuition
  charges.
* After you have completed your first term at USF, you can [request a reclassification of your residency status](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/residency/) from the Office of the Registrar.

A dependent student is considered a legal resident of the same state as his or her
parent or legal guardian (the claimant). If the claimant is a legal guardian and NOT

IN ADDITION to documentation required for in-state status.

[Show Exceptions](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/residency-information.aspx)

classification for in-state tuition purposes when supporting documentation is submitted.
A student should only request residency classification using one of these categories
if they do not qualify as either an independent or a dependent student.

Students must submit the supporting documentation along with the [Residency Form](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status "Residency Form"). All letters of verification must include a contact name and telephone number so
