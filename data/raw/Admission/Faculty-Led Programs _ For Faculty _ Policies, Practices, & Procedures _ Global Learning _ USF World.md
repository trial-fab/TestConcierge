## Faculty-Led Programs

Faculty-led global learning experiences are programs in which the academic instruction
on site is provided by USF faculty or host-country instructors teaching existing courses
equivalent to those available at USF. Typically, they are short-term (from 1 to 12
weeks) and offered during the summer or winter/spring breaks. Faculty-led semester-long
programs is an area of development, but is less common.

EAO encourages early, informal consultation by faculty and units for program planning
and encourages coordinated programming among departments.

**Please Note: The proposal process is being paused for the Academic Year 2026 - 2027
and new proposals will not be considered.**

In order to programs are developed in time for recruitment each year, proposals are
due the academic year before. All proposals are submitted by colleges on behalf of
their departments. Some colleges have earlier deadlines in order to carefully review
proposed programming and evaluate the impact on their overall internationalization
plan. Faculty members are encouraged to speak to their chairs and their college dean's
designated representative for global affairs to insure they meet any internal deadlines.
The Global Learning Office welcomes early consultation and are happy to assist interested
faculty members and departments think through their intended programming prior to
initiating the proposal process.
