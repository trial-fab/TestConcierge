Each University of South Floirda (USF) campus offers a unique living environment for
students to take in and enjoy by themselves and with friends! Whether you are in Tampa,
St. Petersburg, or Sarasota-Manatee, USF has plenty to offer in terms of things to
do when you are not studying. We encourage students to check on BullsConnect, professors,
or official USF communications on learning what is new to do.

### Tampa

#### USF Botanical Gardens

The USF Botanical Gardens offers a peaceful home-away-from-home experience that is
away from the busy atmosphere of studying and work. Students can explore the natural
wonders of Florida ecology for free near the southwestern corner of campus.

#### Contemproary Art Museum

Contemproary Art Museum is located near the Marshall Student Center contributing a
rotation of free exhibits from world renown artists to our wonderfully talented students.

#### USF Riverfront Park

USF Riverfront Park gives students the opportunity to get away from campus in a more
secluded and fun setting along the Hillsborough River. The Riverfront Park gives fun
at a relatively low cost to students from ropes courses to water-craft rentals.
