## Immigration

The [Office of International Services](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-services/index.aspx) (OIS) can assist students through the process of applying for a student visa. After
students receive their initial acceptance from the Office of International Admissions,
they will receive an email from the Office of International Services Team letting
them know it is time to login to [iStart](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-services/before-you-arrive/istart.aspx) – USF's international student portal – and start the GloBull Start Process.

All new international students must use iStart to complete the Glo-Bull Start checklist.
The Glo-Bull Start checklist is designed to guide students through all of the immigration-related
tasks they must complete as a new international student at USF.

Students are encouraged to bookmark the iStart webpage, because they will continue
to use it for various tasks while they are enrolled at USF.

Students may contact the Office of International Services via their website or at
globullstart@usf.edu if they have any questions about iStart.

#### Immigration at the Airport

When students arrive to the United States, an immigration officer at the airport will
inspect their passport, visa, immigration documents (e.g., I-20/DS-2019), admissions
documents from USF, and letters indicating how they will be financially supported
when living in the United States.

Students should keep their travel documents in a place that is easily available. They
should not pack this information away in their luggage.

The I-94 record is very important because it shows students their admission status.
After arriving to the United States, students will be able to access their I-94 admissions
record and [learn more](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home) on the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol's [I94 official website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home).

The customs officials may inspect international baggage coming in to the United States
for illegal materials. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) canines will sometimes
sniff baggage for illegal drugs or plants. Additionally, electronic devices, such
as smartphones, tablets and laptops, may be opened/unlocked and searched by these
officials.

Students should contact their airline or travel agency to learn about restrictions
for their carry-on luggage. A list of [Prohibited and Restricted Items](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) is available from the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Office.
