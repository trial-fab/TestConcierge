## Transportation to/from the Airport

**At this time, USF does not offer airport pick-up options for students.** Students are responsible for booking their own transportation from the airport to
the university or their off-campus residences.

When booking flights, students should consider their [arrival time](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-student-support/new-students/index.aspx) and make plans with transportation from the airport to their accommodations, such
as a hotel, accordingly.

For more information about arriving during non-business hours, please see the "Important"
box found on the [Welcome](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-student-support/new-students/index.aspx) page.

### Important Tips for Securing a Ride

1. 1. Consider your booking options.
      * Pre-booking: Recommended for all, but strongly encouraged for minors (under 18), those who will
        not have cell phone coverage upon arrival, those in need of accommodations such as
        lots of large luggage, 2+ passengers, car seats, etc.
      * Booking upon arrival:  Likely using Uber or Lyft. You will need cell phone service. We caution all to
        ensure they book through apps and verify driver information before entering the vehicle.
   2. Please ensure you are booking with a license and insured ride option. You can and
      should ask for proof.
   3. Ensure that your drop off location is open and available for you to check in.  Most
      car services will not assist you once they have reached your drop off location.
   4. Please note that USF is not affiliated, recommending, nor responsible for *any* ride option.

### Transportation to Campus
