## What to Do if You’re Denied Admission as a Freshman

Admission to the University of South Florida is very competitive—meaning we’re unfortunately unable to admit all students, even those who may be eligible
and qualified for admission.

We know being denied is stressful, but the good news is there are other ways to become
a Bull!

* [**FUSE Transfer Program**](https://www.usf.edu/undergrad/transfer-student-success/fuse/get-started/index.aspx): You can earn an associate’s degree at a local community or state college, then transfer
  to USF and complete your bachelor’s degree.
* [**Upper Level Transfer**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/transfer/admission-information/academic-requirements.aspx): If you are not local to the Tampa Bay area, you may be considered as an upper-level
  transfer after completing your associate’s degree.

Additionally, you also may be able to apply for graduate or certificate programs at
USF after you complete your undergraduate program at another institution.

Want to look into other options? Check out our [admissions blog post on what to do if you’re denied admission to college](https://admissions.usf.edu/blog/denied-admission-to-college-what-you-can-do).

### Appealing a USF Admissions Decision

**Students who apply to USF and are denied may appeal the decision, but please know
that very few of those appeals (<10%) are granted, and the decision of the Faculty
Committee is final.** We encourage denied applicants to make alternative plans, including enrolling in one
of the 28 colleges in the [Florida College System](http://www.fldoe.org/schools/higher-ed/fl-college-system/index.stml "Florida College System").

##### Appeal Deadlines

| Entry Term | Deadline |
| --- | --- |
| Summer Semester | April 1, or within 2 weeks if denied after March 15 |
| Fall Semester | April 1, or within 2 weeks if denied after March 15 |
| Spring Semester | December, 1 or within 2 weeks if denied after November 15 |

#### Reasons to Submit an Appeal

There are several reasons why you might decide to submit an appeal. Perhaps one or
more of your grades from 9th-11th grade changed, increasing your GPA. You may have had a medical issue that affected your academics, or a life circumstance that had a negative impact
on you. *Reasons that USF will accept an appeal may vary.*

#### Documents to Include in Your Appeal

When you submit your appeal, there are supporting documents you must include, and you must submit everything in one package. If you do not turn everything in at once, it will result in a delayed processing time. Documents
to include are:

* A letter of appeal requesting reconsideration, including information regarding the
  reason for your appeal **(REQUIRED)**
* Official high school transcript including your most recent semester grades **(REQUIRED)**
* Letters of recommendation from teachers, professors or academic advisors familiar
  with your academic history **(RECOMMENDED)**
* New test scores if you were denied due to low test scores **(AS APPLICABLE)**
* Documentation verifying your disability along with letter of appeal **(AS APPLICABLE)**

#### How to Submit Your Appeal

You must submit your complete appeal package, including all items, to:

**Faculty Committee on Student Admissions**
**University of South Florida
4202 E. Fowler Avenue, SVC 1036
Tampa, FL 33620-6900**

Remember, failure to submit all items together will result in a delayed processing time.
