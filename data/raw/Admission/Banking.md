### Banking Tips

Students should look into opening a bank account to keep track of money and finances,
recieve money into an account (deposit) for an on-campus job, send and receive funds
internationally, or obtain student loans. Opening an account in person rather than
online or via telephone is advisable.

[Show What do banks require to open an account as in international student?](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-student-support/living-tampa/banking.aspx)

Each bank will have a different list of requirements for what students need. When
students open an account, they will generally need the following:

* A passport,
* Verification/Letter of enrollment at university,
* Immigration documents I-94, I-20, or DS-2019,
* Proof of residence (example: a utility bill or letter with U.S. residential address),
* Secondary form of identification with signature (like USF ID card or birth certificate).

Some banks may require individuals to have a Social Security Number (SSN), so students
may want to ask about this requirement when they begin their applications to open
an account.

*Note:* you can only get an SSN if you obtain employment. If you need to apply for a SSN
as an international student and are eligible, you can follow the instructions from
the [Social Security Administration (SSA)](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10181.pdf) on how to obtain a card.

[Show What should I look for when choosing a bank?](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-student-support/living-tampa/banking.aspx)

When choosing to open an account, students should look at the location of the nearest
bank branch from where they are going to live, if the bank has any fees associated
with opening an account or any reoccurring fees (for example, monthly maintenance,
domestic/international transfer, a minimum balance), or if the bank offers any perks
(cash back, free museum passes, etc.).
