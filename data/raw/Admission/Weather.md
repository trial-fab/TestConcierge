### Tampa Bay Weather Year-Round Overview

Tampa Bay enjoys a warm, subtropical climate that attracts visitors and residents
year-round. Known for its abundant sunshine and coastal breezes, the region experiences
two main seasons: a warm, dry season (fall and winter) and a hot, humid, rainy season
(spring and summer).

#### Fall (October – November)

Temperatures gradually cool to the mid-70s to mid-80s °F (24°C to 29°C). Rainfall
decreases, and humidity levels become more comfortable.

#### Winter (December – February)

Mild and pleasant, with average daytime temperatures ranging from 60°F to 75°F (16°C
to 24°C). It's the driest season, making it ideal for outdoor activities.

#### Spring (March – May)

Temperatures begin to rise, ranging from the low 70s to mid-80s °F (21°C to 29°C).
Humidity increases gradually, and spring brings beautiful blooms and occasional brief
showers.

#### Summer (June – September)

Hot, humid, and rainy. Daily highs often reach the low 90s °F (32°C+), with frequent
afternoon thunderstorms. It's important to stay hydrated, wear sunscreen, and be mindful
of severe weather alerts during hurricane season (June 1 – November 30).

Whether you're exploring the beaches, biking around campus, or attending outdoor events,
Tampa Bay's climate offers plenty of opportunities to enjoy the outdoors throughout
the year—with just a little planning for the heat and rain.

### Adivsory Weather Conditions

Tampa Bay is home to several weather phenomena that is important to know and understand.

#### UV Index and Heat

The area is known during the Spring, Summer, and Fall seasons to have considerable
heat and humidity. It is important for students to be aware of how hot it can get,
especially as some days the "feels like" temperature is more than the actual temperature.
Students should apply sunscreen during peak sunny hours during the day where the UV
index is higher to prevent skin damange. Students should also be mindful about carrying
water with them, epsecially if they are out and about.

#### Tropical Storms and Hurricanes

Students should be mindful about the potential for Tropical Storm and Hurricane awareness
that may impact their studies during Summer and Fall. There is always a chance a weather
event may impact our region, but it is never garunteed. Tropical Storms and Hurricanes
path can be predicted to a certainty, which is why it is important for students to
know how to prepare for a weather storm, what to do before and during it hits the
area, and what to do in the aftermath.

### What to Pack

Light clothing that can be layered is appropriate for most of the year, although students
may need a coat in the cooler months. An umbrella, rainboots, and other rain gear
may be helpful during the summer and fall months. Students may also want to consider
the size and layout of USF's campus and come prepared to walk, so they should consider
bringing comfortable clothing to wear in these different types of weather conditions.
