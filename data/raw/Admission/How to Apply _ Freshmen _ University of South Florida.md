## How to Apply | Freshman Students

**![Three USF freshmen students hanging out together on campus.](./How to Apply _ Freshmen _ University of South Florida_files/how-to-apply-freshman.jpg)**

You can apply for admission using USF’s online application or the Common App. USF
does not have a preference between the two, so choose whichever application you would
like.

Check out [our deadlines](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/dates-deadlines.aspx) to ensure you don't miss out on term selection, scholarships, campus choice and more.

### APPLY IN FOUR EASY STEPS:

Ready to get started? Here’s everything you need to do to complete your application
package.

![white numeral one on a green background](./How to Apply _ Freshmen _ University of South Florida_files/adm_number-scale-left-justified.jpg)

### Step 1: Submit Your Application

It all starts with an application! At USF, you can apply using our online application
or apply to USF through the Common App.

[Apply Through USF](https://admissions.usf.edu/application)

[Apply Through Common App](https://www.commonapp.org/)

[Watch Our Common App Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO0mxcnqlW4)

![white numeral two on a green background](./How to Apply _ Freshmen _ University of South Florida_files/adm_number-scale-left-justified2.jpg)

### Step 2: Pay Your Application Fee

Pay the nonrefundable, $30 application fee or submit an ACT, CLT or SAT [application fee waiver](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/how-to-apply.aspx#fee-waiver) to admissions@usf.edu.

![white numeral three on a green background](./How to Apply _ Freshmen _ University of South Florida_files/adm_number-scale-left-justified3.jpg)

### Step 3: Submit Your STARS

After you apply, you will need to fill out the  [Self-Reported Transcript and Academic Record System](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx) (STARS, formerly SSAR). Log in to your [Applicant Portal](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status "Applicant Portal") to complete your STARS submission.

*If you have completed any high school coursework **outside** of the U.S., you may not need to complete the STARS. You will need to submit official
transcripts from your institutions attended.*

![white numeral four on a green background](./How to Apply _ Freshmen _ University of South Florida_files/adm_number-scale-leftjustified-4.jpg)

### Step 4: Submit Your SAT, ACT or CLT Scores

Submit test scores directly from the testing service to be considered for admission.

[Request SAT Scores](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/sending-scores/how-to-send)

[Request ACT Scores](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/sending-your-scores.html)

[Request CLT Scores](https://www.cltexam.com/tests/results/)

### Test Score Notes to Remember

* **Use USF's Code to send us your scores:**
  + **SAT Code for USF:** 5828
  + **ACT Code for USF:** 0761
  + **CLT:** Please select University of South Florida from dropdown on CLT website
* **Register with Your Legal Name:** When you register for and take the SAT, ACT or CLT, make sure you use your legal name
  as it appears on your official high school transcripts so your test scores are accurately
  reported to USF.
* **Superscoring:** Students are only required to submit either SAT, ACT or CLT scores, but they are encouraged
  to submit one of each. USF superscores, meaning we consider your highest submitted
  section scores across all SAT, ACT and CLT test dates. Final admission decisions are
  made using only your highest cumulative scores.
* **Accepted Test Score Submission:** Scores must come directly from SAT, ACT and CLT testing services. USF will not accept
  scores from the Common App portal, your guidance counselor or PDF screenshot.
* **Accepted Test Score Dates:** Students applying for Summer or Fall admission must take the SAT, ACT or CLT before
  December for USF to receive scores in time for an admissions decision. Register for
  the tests early to give yourself the best chance at admission!

That’s it! Once you’ve completed all four steps, the admissions team will take some time to review your file and render a decision.
Now that you've applied, check out your next steps below to keep your application
moving forward.

### What's Next?

#### Apply to the Judy Genshaft Honors College

Once you apply to USF, you will also be able to apply to our prestigious Judy Genshaft
Honors College. [Explore the benefits](https://www.usf.edu/honors/prospective-students/benefits.aspx) of becoming an Honors student and submit your application if this experience interests
you.

[How to Apply](https://www.usf.edu/honors/prospective-students/first-time-in-college-admissions.aspx)

#### **Submit Residency Documentation**

When you apply to USF, the Office of Admissions uses information on your application
to determine whether you are an in-state or out-of-state resident. This classification
is important because it sets your tuition rates.

**Please note:** students are informed of their residency status once admitted to the university.

[Residency Information](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/residency-information.aspx)

#### **Submit Final Transcripts After Graduation**

USF doesn’t require you to submit transcripts when you apply. However, if admitted,
your admission is contingent upon submitting final high school transcripts and any
college transcripts showing dual enrollment coursework you’ve completed.

[Submit Transcripts](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/submit-transcripts.aspx)

### Application Fee Waiver

We will waive your admissions application fee if you can show evidence that the fee
creates severe financial hardship and serves as a deterrent to your ability to seek
admission to USF. Please submit an original ACT, CLT or SAT Request for Deferral/Waiver
of College Admission Application Fee Waiver Form.

Typically, you may secure this via your high school guidance counselor, who will send
it to USF on your behalf. Although this is the easiest way to ensure the waiver of
an application fee, the Director of Admissions will also consider requests for a waiver.
