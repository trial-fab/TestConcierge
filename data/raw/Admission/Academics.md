## Academics

### Grades

The grade for most study abroad courses is A-F on all faculty-led, exchange, affiliate
and non-affiliate programs.  Most USF courses do not permit satisfactory/unsatisfactory
grading as an option except in such instances as internship courses, and in other
rare cases.

All grades earned on exchange and affiliate programs are converted to USF grades according
to pre-established grade conversion criteria; USF uses World Education Services. All
transfer (affiliate) and exchange credit will be entered into the student’s academic
record as listed on the host institution’s transcript.

### Course Requirements and Registration

All participants in a USF faculty-led program must be registered in the program course
offerings; participants may not audit courses on a study abroad program. Students
on exchange and affiliate programs are expected to follow all registration requirements
of their chosen program / host institution.

### Attendance

Students are expected to follow the attendance policy of their program or host institution.
Attendance policies vary from program to program and or even course to course. Missed
absences due to independent travel are generally considered unexcused absences.

Many instructors assess both attendance and participation when assigning a final course
grade. Attendance alone does not guarantee a positive participation grade; the student
should be prepared for class and engage in class discussion.
