### Concurrent Degree Programs

courses required for one degree may be applied to another degree that requires the
same courses. Students can share up to 15 percent of credits required for both degrees.
After gaining admission to the first program, submit the Application for Concurrent
Degrees and all necessary credentials to the second program for consideration.

### Bachelor's/Master's Pathways

Bachelor's/Master's Pathways allow academically qualified students to complete an
undergraduate degree and a graduate degree on an accelerated timeline. Typically,
students will complete some of the required graduate coursework while still an undergraduate,
which counts towards both degrees. After the student completes the undergraduate degree
requirements, they are converted to graduate status to fulfill the remaining requirements.
