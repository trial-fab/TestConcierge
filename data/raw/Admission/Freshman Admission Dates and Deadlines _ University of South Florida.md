## Freshman Admission Dates and Deadlines

![Four USF students taking a picture together while holding up the bulls sign.](./Freshman Admission Dates and Deadlines _ University of South Florida_files/adm-cms-deadlines-freshman.jpg)

Our admissions dates and deadlines are below. Pay close attention to the Early Action
deadline, as we recommend you apply as early as you can! Applying by this deadline
gives you the best chance at getting your preferred campus and preferred term. You
may apply as early as August of your senior year.

### FALL/SUMMER 2026 SEMESTER START

| Application Type | Application Deadline | *[Materials Deadline](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/dates-deadlines.aspx#deadline-types)* | *[Decision Release](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/dates-deadlines.aspx#decision)* |

### Spring 2026 Application Has Closed

Due to the high volume of applications, **we have closed the Spring 2026 freshman application to all of USF's three campuses
early**. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.

*Note:* This only applies to first-time-in-college, or freshman, applicants. If you have 12
or more college credits through coursework at a different college or university (*not* including dual enrollment), and you are interested in applying to USF as a transfer
student, check our [transfer deadlines](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/transfer/admission-information/dates-deadlines.aspx).

---

### When Should I Apply?

Your college admissions journey is your own, so there isn't a perfect answer for everyone,
but you should take the following into consideration:

* **Early Action: November 1, 2025**
  + Applying before this deadline comes with several major benefits, so if possible, we recommend applying Early Action.
* **Regular Decision: December 15, 2025**
  + This is a good option if you're not ready to apply by the Early Action deadline, but
    but you want to get your college applications submitted before USF closes for winter
    break.
* **Scholarship Consideration Deadline: January 15, 2026**
  + If you submit your application and materials by the Scholarship Consideration Deadline,
    the Office of Admissions ***automatically considers you for merit scholarships***.
  + If you miss this deadline, you'll still have the opportunity to apply for [other scholarships](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/cost-of-attendance/scholarships.aspx), but we recommend giving yourself as many opportunities for success as possible.

As the application deadlines pass, admission to USF can become more competitive, so
we suggest applying as early as you can.

### Don't Forget to Apply to the Judy Genshaft Honors College

As you apply for USF admission, you'll also have the opportunity to [submit your application to the Judy Genshaft Honors College](https://www.usf.edu/honors/prospective-students/first-time-in-college-admissions.aspx). Students in the JGHC are part of a culture of academic excellence at USF and enjoy
exclusive benefits.

* Generous [academic scholarships](https://www.usf.edu/honors/prospective-students/scholarships.aspx)
* Priority [course registration](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/registration_times.aspx)
* On-campus [Honors housing communities](https://www.usf.edu/honors/prospective-students/housing.aspx)
* Honors [study abroad experiences](https://www.usf.edu/honors/programs/study-abroad.aspx)
* Exclusive internship and [research opportunities](https://www.usf.edu/honors/programs/undergraduate-research.aspx)

 **Note:** **Deadlines and requirements to apply to the JGHC differ from those set by the Office
of Admissions.** [Review the JGHC website](https://www.usf.edu/honors/prospective-students/first-time-in-college-admissions.aspx) carefully and plan to submit your application by the deadline.

[Apply to the JGHC Today](https://www.usf.edu/honors/prospective-students/first-time-in-college-admissions.aspx)

### What is the Materials Deadline?

When you apply to USF, you'll have two important deadlines you want to meet, no matter
your application type.

The **application deadline** is the date you must submit your application for admission. At this time, documents
and supplemental materials aren't due.

The **materials deadline** is the date you must submit your application materials. This includes:

* Application fee or fee waiver
* Test score submission
* STARS submission

The materials deadline gives you a little time to complete your application package
after submission. However, you should always submit your application and materials
as soon as you can to allow plenty of time for processing.

[Learn How to Apply](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/how-to-apply.aspx)

### What is an Early Action Application Deadline?

Early Action is a non-binding way to apply and receive a priority admissions decision.
Applying early can have its advantages, so we encourage applicants to meet this deadline
if possible. You should apply by the Early Action deadline for perks such as:

* Priority [campus](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/why-usf/our-campuses/index.aspx) consideration
* Priority term consideration
* Automatic consideration for merit scholarships

All you have to do to apply Early Action is submit your application by the Early Action
deadline and all application materials by the Early Action Materials deadline.

[Apply to USF](https://admissions.usf.edu/application)

*Please note: Preferred USF campus and entry term are not guaranteed.*

### When Will I Find Out If I Was Admitted?

We know you're eager to join the Herd, so make note of the decision release date associated
with your application deadline. For example, if you complete your application on or
before the Early Action application deadline and submit all your materials by the
Early Action materials deadline, you can expect to hear from us after 5 p.m. on Early
Action decision release day.

[Understand My Admission Decision](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/understanding-your-decision.aspx)

### How Does Rolling Decision Work?

Rolling decision means that the sooner you apply, the sooner you could receive an
admission decision. Rolling decision can be helpful for students who miss our Early
Action deadlines and our Regular decision deadlines, but we always recommend applying
Early Action if you can.
