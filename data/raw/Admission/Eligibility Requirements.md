## Eligibility Requirements

[Show Disciplinary Probation](https://www.usf.edu/world/education-abroad/policies-practices-procedures/eligibility.aspx)

USF reviews applicant records with the Student Conduct and Ethical Development office.
 Failure to disclose previous offenses during the application process may negatively
impact a student's ability to participate in a program and could be grounds for dismissal.
Students on disciplinary probation or with a disciplinary record will be considered
for a study abroad program on a case-by-case basis. Students with minor offenses typically
are approved to participate. Students with more serious cases may be required to fulfill
additional requirements or in some cases may not be allowed to participate.  Students
who are blocked from attending a program due to disciplinary probation or action may
be disqualified from participation and will be held to the Financial Terms and Conditions
signed by students.

[Show Minors Under the Age of 18](https://www.usf.edu/world/education-abroad/policies-practices-procedures/eligibility.aspx)

Students must be 18 years old at the time of participation. Students can apply to
a program when they are under 18 but must be 18 at the time of travel.

[Show Holds](https://www.usf.edu/world/education-abroad/policies-practices-procedures/eligibility.aspx)

Students must clear any holds on their USF student record prior to their departure
by working directly with the USF college or office issuing the hold. Holds can prevent
registration, transfer of credit processed and financial aid (if applicable) from
being released. Global Learning is not able to clear or override holds for students.
 Students will not be allowed to participate in a program if they are unable to register
because of a hold on their record. Students who are not registered due to holds on
their account, may be disqualified from participation and will be held to the Financial
Terms and Conditions signed by students.

[Show Academic Standing](https://www.usf.edu/world/education-abroad/policies-practices-procedures/eligibility.aspx)

Students are expected to remain in [good academic standing](https://catalog.usf.edu/content.php?catoid=21&navoid=3512#academic-standing) during the term prior to their study abroad experience. Students not in good academic
standing may be disqualified from participation and will be held to the Financial
Terms and Conditions signed by students.  Students on academic probation may not be
accepted into Global Learning programs for the duration of any probationary period.
Students blocked from registration in the coursework associated with their overseas
program (ie failing a prerequisite, going into major reselect, etc.) may also be blocked
from participation. Students going into major reselect must complete a new course
selection form with their new academic advisor. Students on probation may be allowed
to study abroad, pending the approval of their college advising office. Students on
academic suspension may not participate in a USF Global Learning program.

Students should notify the EAO as early as possible if there is a possibility that
they will be on academic probation during the study abroad experience. EAO will consult
with the student’s academic adviser to determine if the student will be allowed to
participate, and under what parameters (if any). Should student’s academic standing
or status change after program deadlines, they will be held to the Financial Terms
and Conditions signed by students if they are no longer eligible to participate.
