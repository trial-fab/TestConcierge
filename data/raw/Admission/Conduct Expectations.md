## Conduct Expectations

Students are expected to abide by local laws of the host country, the policies of
the host institution, as well as adhere to USF’s [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/policies/student-conduct-policies.aspx). Conduct violations will be reported to appropriate USF offices, including but not
limited to Student Affairs, the office of Student Conduct and Ethical Development
as well as to college and departmental representatives.

[Show Cultural Sensitivity](https://www.usf.edu/world/education-abroad/policies-practices-procedures/conduct.aspx)

Participants must conduct themselves in a manner that shows respect and consideration
for the host country ***and fellow travelers***. Further, if behavior is deemed detrimental to the functioning of the program or
offensive to the host culture, students are subject to dismissal from the program. As
a result, they may lose academic credit, may not be reimbursed program costs or tuition,
and may be liable to repay tuition and/or scholarships (if awarded) for the experience.
Certain programs and locations may require significant modifications of behavior,
particularly related to alcohol use, clothing, regardless of local customs and practices.

[Show Alcohol Misuse](https://www.usf.edu/world/education-abroad/policies-practices-procedures/conduct.aspx)

Any behavior deemed disruptive by the program leader or host institution, and/or that
interferes with the rights of students due to alcohol consumption, will lead to disciplinary
action. The entire USF Alcohol Policy can be read [here](http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies-and-procedures/pdfs/policy-30-023.pdf).

Alcohol misuse will not be tolerated on USF Global Learning programs. Students may
be sent home at their own expense for misusing alcohol while abroad.

What is “alcohol misuse?” Alcohol misuse may include, but is not limited to, the consumption
of alcohol contributing in any part or manner to one of the following:

* A student misses any scheduled event because of the effects of alcohol consumption;
* A student becomes ill due to the effects of alcohol consumption;
* A student is disrespectful of others sharing the same or neighboring housing, due
  to the effects of alcohol consumption;
* A student engages in inappropriate behavior toward other individuals following the
  consumption of alcohol;
* A student becomes so intoxicated that he/she cannot walk unassisted;
* A student engages in destructive behavior toward property following the consumption
  of alcohol;
* A student does not abide by the laws of the country in which he or she is staying;
* A student engages in behavior that causes embarrassment to the other members of the
  group, the faculty member(s) or the in-country host(s) following the consumption of
  alcohol;
* A student engages in behavior that causes his/her companions concern for the safety
  of the individual or the group; or Students who transport quantities of alcohol to
  program sites with the intent of sharing the alcohol with members of the group.

[Show Illegal Drug Use](https://www.usf.edu/world/education-abroad/policies-practices-procedures/conduct.aspx)

The use, possession, or commerce of illegal drugs of any form is in violation of the
rules of the program, USF Student Conduct Code, and, in most cases, a violation of
the laws of the host country. If found with any illegal substances, as defined by
USF and/or the host country, students may be immediately dismissed from the program
with corresponding academic and financial penalties. Moreover, in some locations the
use of illegal drugs carry sever criminal penalties. While some drugs illegal in the
US may be considered legal in a host country, students are expected to behave in a
manner as outlined by the USF Student Conduct Code, misuse of any substances, as described
under the alcohol misuse policy above, will be subject to disciplinary action.

[Show Violation of Local Laws](https://www.usf.edu/world/education-abroad/policies-practices-procedures/conduct.aspx)

Students do not enjoy the protections of the US Constitution and legal system while
abroad. All travelers are subject to the laws of the host country, and infractions
of the host country’s laws could result in dismissal from the program and incarceration
in a foreign prison. These infractions may include punishment for activities which,
in the United States, are considered fundamental rights: expression of speech, freedom
of religious beliefs and practices, etc. Neither the U.S. Embassy nor USF have the
legal or financial power to release or represent participants in the event of incarceration.

[Show Self-Endangerment in Global Learning](https://www.usf.edu/world/education-abroad/policies-practices-procedures/conduct.aspx)

USF prioritizes the health and safety of students on global learning opportunities.
Students have a critical role to play in the maintenance of their own well-being,
and students are expected to avoid or remove themselves from situations or conditions
that a reasonable student in similar circumstances could foresee or understand to
be potentially dangerous. Self-endangerment, for the purposes of this policy, includes
activities or behavior that could result in personal harm, such as frequenting dangerous
places, associating with criminals, or participating in extreme activities, attending
demonstrations, or repeated intoxication.
