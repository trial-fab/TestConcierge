## Admissions

International students may contact the Office of International Admissions at international@usf.edu should they have questions about their admissions' application, admissions' scholarships,
or their Florida residency status.

### Submission of Transcripts, Test Scores, and Exam Credits to USF

#### **Freshman Students Only**

**Freshman students must [submit a final high school transcript](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/submit-transcripts.aspx)** and any college transcripts from dual enrollment courses immediately after their high school graduation marks are included in their transcript.

Admission to USF depends upon the receipt of students’ final transcripts. USF can
cancel a student’s admission offer and/or withhold financial aid (including Bright
Futures) if this information is not received by the first day of class.

**Final transcripts must include the following:**

1. 1. 1. Original documents in the native language they were issued in,
      2. Final diploma or statement of completion,
      3. Certified English translations if applicable, and
      4. Any final exam certificates or marksheets. Some common foreign exam scores include:
         AP, IB, GCSE/IGCSE, CSEC/CAPE, CBSE, and WAEC.

Students may contact the International Admissions Team at international@usf.edu with questions about their final transcripts.

For assistance in translating documents into English, the Office of International
Services recommends using the [American Translators Association](https://www.atanet.org/) at <https://www.atanet.org/>.

#### **Transfer Students Only**

Students must submit their final transcripts from each institution attended when completing the final semester at the educational institution they will be transferring
from to attend USF. For students receiving an AA/AS degree, the name and date of their
degree must be indicated on submitted transcripts to be considered completed.

Admission to USF depends upon the receipt of students’ final transcripts. USF will
place a hold on students’ accounts if they fail to submit their transcripts in a timely
manner, which will prevent them from registering for future courses.

Students may log in to Student Self-Service and then go to Student > Admissions >
View My Undergraduate Application Status or View My Graduate Application Status to
review the status of all essential documents for admission.

### Review Your Financial Aid & Scholarships

Students who have been awarded an admissions’ scholarship must remember to accept
the Terms and Conditions of the scholarship to ensure these funds will be provided.

**Students must follow these steps to accept their scholarship award:**

* myUSF > My Resources > Student Self-Service > Financial Aid > My Award and Loan Information
  > Select Aid Year from Dropdown Menu.
* Students must carefully review the requirements of their scholarships under the 'Terms
  & Conditions' tab.
* Students must select 'Accept' to verify that they understand the terms and conditions
  associated with their awards.

*\*\*Important reminder for students from Latin America or the Caribbean who have received
in-state awards based on their citizenship status.\*\**

* The scholarship amount for these students will be accepted. However, the in-state
  tiuition costs will not be updated until the first week of classes after Add/Drop
  period.

#### Take the Math Placement Test

*(Strongly recommended for all Freshman students)*

USF determines the appropriate math courses for students based on their SAT/ACT math
placement scores. Students are encouraged to take their placement test as soon as
possible, preferably before being registered for courses, to ensure they are enrolled
in the correct math courses.

*\*\*Students with an SAT Math score of 670+ or an ACT Math score of 29+ do not need to
take the placement test.\*\**

**Follow these steps to access courses in Canvas:**

* MyUSF > Learning & Teaching Tools > Canvas > Courses > Math Placement Test
* Follow the instructions on the home page, and please read the "Announcements."
