## Self-Reported Transcript and Academic Record (STARS)

![A student using his laptop in the new Judy Genshaft Honors College building.](./Self-Reported Transcript and Academic Record System (STARS) _ University of South Florida_files/adm-ssar-cms-header.jpg)

### Self-Reported TRANSCRIPT and Academic Record SYSTEM (STARS)

USF reviews incoming freshmen via their self-reported transcript and academic record
(STARS). You must submit your STARS to be considered for admission. **It is critical to take the time to understand and accurately complete the STARS before
you submit to the Office of Admissions.**

STARS is a way for you to self-report your courses and grades that you have received,
or expect to receive, to support your application. STARS replaces the high school
and college transcripts portion of your initial application. Accuracy is essential,
so make sure you have a copy of your high school transcript available for reference
when creating your STARS.

Visit your [Applicant Portal](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status) for the personalized link to complete your STARS!

[Applicant Portal](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status)

### WHO IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE STARS?

**If you are currently attending a U.S. high school, regardless of your citizenship
status, you are required to complete the STARS**, but there are a few exceptions.

You ***should not* complete the STARS** if:

* You obtained your [GED](https://www.ged.com/transcripts/international/).
* You are applying as a [transfer student](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/transfer/next-steps/submit-transcripts.aspx).
* You are an [international student](https://usf.edu/admissions/international/next-steps/submit-transcripts.aspx) graduating from a school outside of the U.S. (*except for American-style high schools abroad and schools in Vietnam following the
  national curriculum*).
* You attend a high school that does not issue A-F grades or grades that can be easily
  converted to an A-F grade system.

If you fall into one of these categories, you will need to [submit your official transcripts to USF](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/submit-transcripts.aspx).

### What if I'm An International or Overseas Student?

If you're an international or overseas student, **you *should* complete the STARS** if you...

* Attended a high school regionally accredited in the United States and have all four
  years of coursework and grades on a U.S. high school transcript.
* Attended a Department of Defense Education Activity, or DODEA, school.
* Attended a high school outside the U.S. that follows a standard U.S curriculum (i.e.,
  American-style high schools abroad).
* Attended a high school in Vietnam that follows the Vietnamese national curriculum.

However, **you *should not* complete the STARS** if you...

* Attended a secondary school outside the U.S. that follows a non-U.S. standard curriculum.
* Studied a curriculum that does not align with the standard U.S. system (with the exception
  of the Vietnamese national curriculum).

If you are an international or overseas applicant who attended multiple high schools
and one or more of them *does not* meet the criteria for STARS, submit original or official copies of your transcripts
for those schools.

### Is There a Tutorial to Help Me With My STARS?

Yes! You can watch the STARS YouTube tutorial playlist that reviews the entire process
of completing the STARS, including how to enter specific types of coursework, like
dual enrollment, middle school and more.

If you have specific STARS questions, please reach out to the [STARS Help Desk](https://srarsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).

### STARS Frequently Asked Questions

#### How to Submit Your STARS

[Show Where can I complete the STARS?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)

Submit your STARS on the STARS portal. The link can be found in your [Applicant Portal](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status).

[Show When do I complete the STARS?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)

You can start your STARS in August prior to your senior year, which is when the STARS
website becomes available. You will not be able to link your STARS to your application
until your application has been submitted. While you can begin your admissions application
prior to completing your STARS, your application for admission will be incomplete
until your STARS and test scores have been received.

[Show I have to make changes after I submitted my STARS. What do I do?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)

If you need to make changes to your STARS, please [contact Admissions](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/contact-us/). It is important your information is as accurate as possible before you submit STARS,
so notify the Office of Admissions of any inaccuracies immediately.

[Show When do I need to submit my final high school and college (dual enrollment) transcripts?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)

Students who are admitted to USF must submit their final official transcripts after
graduation. USF admissions staff will use these transcripts to ensure the information
on your STARS is accurate. Any inaccuracies could have the following consequences:

* You could lose your admission to USF.
* Your scholarship could be reduced or rescinded.
* Your course registration may be canceled.

[Show Can I submit my STARS to multiple colleges/universities?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)

Yes, you can use your STARS at any [college or university that accepts STARS](https://srarsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408738060315-Which-colleges-universities-accept-the-SSAR-SRAR-).

#### School-Specific Questions:

[Show I can't find my high school. What should I do?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)

The STARS website uses a database of high school names from The College Board, which
may vary from the everyday name of your school. If you are having a hard time finding
your high school’s name, try using variants of the official school name. For example,
if you attend T. South High School, search “South High School.” Also, make sure you
select the correct state. If you still can’t find your high school, you should contact the Office of Admissions.

[Show Do I have to submit the STARS if I was homeschooled?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)

Yes, if you have completed an educational curriculum created based on the traditional
U.S. system.

[Show What do I do if I attended multiple high schools?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)

List all high schools you have attended and the years you attended them. Enter your
courses and grades under the high school where each course was taken.

If you are an international or overseas applicant who attended multiple high schools
and one or more of them does not meet the criteria for STARS, submit original or official
copies of your transcripts for those schools.

#### Class/Course-Specific Questions

[Show Should I include middle school courses?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)

If courses for high school credit were completed in middle school, then they should
be included on the STARS.

[Show How should I input grades?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)

Please report all grades as they are listed on your transcript/report card(s). Select
the appropriate **Grade Scale**(e.g., letter grades, numeric grades, letter and numbers, decimal grades or other)
on the "Enter High Schools" screen in order to record your grades.

The **Course Level** field on STARS is how you will indicate the type of course you completed or are expected
to complete (e.g., dual enrollment, honors, AP, etc.).

* *Note: if you have taken dual enrollment (DE) courses through a community college or university, the courses
  should be entered under High School with “dual enrollment” as the course level.*

Select the **Course Length** that best represents how long you took the course and how the school issues final
grades (one final grade, semester grades, trimester grades, etc.). Check out STARS's
article on how to list your grades based on Course Length:

* *Note: if you have access to* *both semester grades and year-end grades for a course, please enter the semester grades.*

[STARS Course Length](https://srarsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7423654574747-How-to-Select-a-Course-Length)

Please note that all attempted coursework must be listed on the STARS, including coursework
that receives pass/fail grades and repeated coursework.

If your grades do not fall into one of these categories, contact the Office of Admissions
at admissions@usf.edu.

[Show How do I report grades for my senior year, since I'm still taking classes?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)

List your senior-year classes as “In Progress” since you will have no grades associated
with them. If your schedule changes, you must immediately update your STARS. To make
changes, log into the STARS website with the email and password you used to create
your original STARS.

[Show How should I report summer classes?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)

Enter the class and grade like you would any other class that you have taken during
the regular school year, except record the class in the preceding school year. For
example, if you took a class in the summer between 10th and 11th grade, you would
enter the class as a 10th grade student.

[Show What do I do if I'm graduating in three years instead of four?](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)

Please fill out coursework in the 9th grade, 10th grade and 11th grade sections. Your
12th grade sections should be in-progress.
