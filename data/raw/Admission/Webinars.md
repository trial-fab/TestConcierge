## Webinars

The International Student Support (ISS) team hosts a variety of virtual webinars on
Microsoft Teams to our new and incoming students. The virtual webinar sessions last
45-minutes with a 15-minute Questions and Answers (Q&A) portion typically at the end
to answer any questions.

* Webinars are not required, but are strongly recommended to learn more about completing
  your requirements early and to reduce stress nearing the start of the semester.
* Webinars are communicated a couple times per month in the months leading up to incoming
  student's initial semester.
* Webinars are sent to your USF email address by either Brian or Janna via newinternational@usf.edu

# A list of webinars currently produced by the team is listed as the following:

* Meet your International Student Support Team
* How to Apply for On-Campus Housing at USF
* Living at USF: Rules, Regulations, and Campus Housing Culture
* How to Complete Your Immunization Requirements
* Exploring Your Off-Campus Housing Options
