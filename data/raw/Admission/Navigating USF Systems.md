## Navigating USF Systems

International students are encouraged to learn about the following university systems
that will allow them to find their USF-related email accounts, academic course information
and other important resources such as the campus library, health clinic, and recreational
facility.

New students to USF should begin their journey by creating a NetID, accessing their
iStart portal, and logging into their newly created USF email account.

### Net ID

Your NetID is your unique user ID that provides access to essential university online
services, including your USF email, Student Self-Service (formerly OASIS), and Canvas.
It functions like a username (e.g., rockydbull) and also forms the first part of your
USF email address (e.g., rockydbull@mail.usf.edu).

USF students will use their Net ID to sign in to all of their USF accounts. As soon
as students activate their NetID, their USF email will also be created automatically.

[Show Students may follow these steps to create their NetID:](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-student-support/new-students/navigating-usf-systems.aspx)

1. Go to [netid.usf.edu](https://netid.usf.edu/).
2. Select 'Activate your NetID' and complete the requested information.

Students may email the USF Information Technology help desk at help@usf.edu for assistance in activating their Net ID. When emailing the help desk, students
must include their full name and U number in their communications.

### NOTE

Once students have created their USF Net ID numbers, they will be asked to choose
an authentication login option for security purposes. USF strongly recommends that
international students use the authenticator app or their email addresses for authentication purposes. Students should not use international phone numbers
to authenticate their accounts, as these contact details may not be available in the
USA.

---

### iStart

[iStart](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-services/before-you-arrive/istart.aspx) is USF’s international student portal. All new international students must use iStart
to complete the Glo-Bull Start checklist, which is designed to guide students through
all of their immigration-related tasks as a new international student at USF.

The  Office of International Services will contact international students via email
about completing their Glo-Bull Start tasks once they have been notified of their
admission to USF.

Students may contact the [Office of International Services](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-services/index.aspx) via their website or email at globullstart@usf.edu  if they have any questions about iStart.

[Show MyUSF (my.usf.edu)](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-student-support/new-students/navigating-usf-systems.aspx)

[MyUSF](https://my.usf.edu/) is the official USF webpage that allows students to view their course information,
meal plans, on-campus housing information, and to open their email accounts.

Students will need to use their Net ID and password to log in to the MYUSF website.

### USF Email

Students should check their USF email regularly, because they may receive important
messages from their professors, academic advisors, immigration advisors, and other
USF officials.

When students activate their NetID, their USF email will also be created. Students
may also download the Outlook application (app) to their smartphones, and enable notifications,
so that they do not miss any important messages.

### Locating your USFID (U#)

![USF ID badge](./Navigating USF Systems_files/sample-id.jpg)

Your USFID is your personal student identification number. It is first provided to
you in your acceptance letter via your personal email. Also known as a U# (# being
“Number”), it follows a format like U12345678. Your USFID is important for communicating
with USF administrators to identify information related to your personal file and
necessary information you may inquire about when seeking answers.

USF students should always include their USFID numbers in any communication with USF
staff and faculty.
