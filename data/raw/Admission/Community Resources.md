### Religious life

USF has on-campus faith communities available through the [Religious and Spiritual Life at USF](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/resources/religious-and-spiritual-life.aspx). If you do not see an on-campus Religious and Spiritual Life association that aligns
with your beliefs, [you can establish one](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/resources/contact-us.aspx).

USF does have private facilities for prayer, meditation, and relaxation called "Serenity
Rooms". On the Tampa campus, you can find private spaces at the [Marshall Student Center](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/msc/building-amenities/serenity-room.aspx) (MSC) on the third floor and another at the [WELL facility](https://health.usf.edu/well/student-district-facilities) in the Medical Services district.

Several off-campus options are available to the USF community as well. If you do not
see a community that aligns with your beliefs, you can inquire with Alex Iler on how to find one so that we can add it to our growing list.
