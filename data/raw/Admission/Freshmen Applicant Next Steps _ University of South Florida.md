![Student studying in a booth on campus.](./Freshmen Applicant Next Steps _ University of South Florida_files/202108-usfsp-first-day-classes.jpg)

So, you applied to USF. Yay! We hope we can welcome you into the Herd, but in the
meantime, you’ll need to complete a few key tasks. Here's your next steps checklist!

### ✅ Access the USF Applicant Portal

**While we have a helpful guide below, your applicant portal is the best source of information, with next steps tailored
to you.** The USF Applicant Portal is a central location where you can track your application
progress, access required forms and see what documents you still need to submit.

If you applied for **Summer or Fall 2026**, you can see updates about your application status in the [new USF Applicant Portal](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status). Remember to check it often!

[Open the New Applicant Portal](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status)

### Spring 2026 Applicants

If you've applied to USF for the Spring 2026 term, you can check your application
status, submit documents and receive important updates in our [Legacy Applicant Portal](http://admissions.usf.edu/applicant-portal).

[Visit the Legacy Applicant Portal](http://admissions.usf.edu/applicant-portal)

### ✅ Pay Your Application Fee

Pay the nonrefundable, $30 application fee. If you’re experiencing financial hardship,
you can submit an [**application fee waiver**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/how-to-apply.aspx#fee-waiver) to **admissions@usf.edu**.

### ✅ Submit Your Test Scores

Whether you take the SAT, ACT, or CLT, you need to **[submit your test scores](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/how-to-apply.aspx#submit-test-scores)** to USF as part of your application package.

### ✅ Complete Your STARS

All freshman applicants must complete and **[submit the STARS](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx)** *(formerly SSAR/SRAR)* as part of their application package.

### ✅ Apply to the Honors College

Join a community of high-achievers and take advantage of exclusive study abroad opportunities
with the Judy Genshaft Honors College — but first, **[submit your application](https://www.usf.edu/honors/prospective-students/first-time-in-college-admissions.aspx)**!

Then, [apply for the Genspiration Global Explorers Scholarship](https://www.usf.edu/honors/prospective-students/genspiration-global-explorers-scholarship.aspx) to be eligible for $10,000 in funding to take your ambitions beyond Tampa Bay. This

### ✅ Update Your Application

If you need to, log into your [Applicant Portal](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status) to complete any necessary forms.

  attended, or personal information, like an update to your citizenship status.

* **Application Update Form**: Complete this form if you want to update one of the following selections on your
  application:
  + Change of Term
  + Change of Major
  + Change of Campus
* **Explanation of Activities**: If we need you to submit this, it will appear as a checklist item in your Applicant
  Portal. If we ask for this, it's because we need more information about your educational
  history or unexpected gaps in your education.
* **Home School Transcript**: Submit this if you completed some or all of your education via homeschooling.
* **Social Security Number (SSN) Update Form**: Complete this if you need to *modify* your existing SSN on your student record.
  + If you need to *add* your SSN to your student record, please [submit the update here](https://cloud.usf.edu/Admissions/banner).
* **Third Party Authorization Form**: Submit this form if someone else will be communicating with the Office of Admissions
  on your behalf.
* **Undergraduate Residency Declaration Form**: After you're admitted to USF, you may need to submit this form to be considered
  for classification as a Florida resident for tuition purposes. You can [learn more about residency on our website](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/residency-information.aspx).

If you need a paper application for admission or a PDF version of any of the above
forms, please reach out to admissions@usf.edu or call 813-974-3350 to let us know.

**Please Note**: Any update to your Application Checklist may not be reflected on your [Applicant Portal](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status) until the Office of Admissions processes your forms. Please allow up to 4-6 weeks
from the time the form is received for processing.
