## Transfer Admission Dates and Deadlines

Admissions decisions are made on a [rolling basis](https://admissions.usf.edu/blog/what-are-rolling-admissions) as we receive completed applications and all supporting documents. However, document
processing can take up to 4-6 weeks, and USF reserves the right to close transfer
admission earlier if warranted by enrollment limitations and the number of applications
for admission, so make sure to submit your application as soon as you can!
