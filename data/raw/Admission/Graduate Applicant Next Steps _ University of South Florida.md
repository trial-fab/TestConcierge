Thank you for applying to the University of South Florida as a graduate student! While
you wait for your admission decision, review the steps below to make sure your application
is complete and up-to-date.

### ✅ Complete Your Application

After you apply to USF, you'll need to submit a few supplemental materials for your
application to be considered complete:

* **Application Fee:** All USF applicants are required to pay a nonrefundable, $30 application fee or request
  a fee waiver in cases of financial hardship.
* **Program-Specific Materials:** Each USF graduate program requires their own supplemental materials. Check your program's
  website to confirm, but these materials may include:
  + Statement of Purpose or Personal Statement
  + Resumé or Curriculum Vitae (CV)
  + Unofficial College Transcripts
  + Letter(s) of Recommendation
  + Test Scores (e.g., GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, etc.)
  + Portfolio or Writing Sample

For updates on the status of your graduate application, reach out to your Graduate
Program Coordinator or graduate@usf.edu.

### ✅ Submit Forms

Sometimes we need a little more information to make a decision about your application.
If you’ve been asked to complete an additional form, please download it, fill out
all requested information and submit it to the Office of Admissions along with any
requested documentation.

Include your **full name, date of birth and** [university ID number](https://netid.usf.edu/ "university ID number ")(once assigned) on every form you submit. Unless otherwise specified, you may either

### Appeals & Requests

[Show Appeal for Reconsideration](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/graduate/next-steps/check-application-status.aspx)

Denied applicants who meet the minimum standards may make a request for reconsideration
in writing. Send this request to the graduate director of the major to which you applied.
Email your Appeal for Reconsideration directly to the graduate program and present
additional evidence of your potential academic success at USF. This must be done **within 30 days of the date of denial.**

**Applicants denied admission to a major are eligible to apply as a non-degree seeking
student. Course selection restrictions may apply. Applicants must submit a non-degree
seeking student application and fee to the Office of the Registrar online.**

[Show Deferment of Admission Request](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/graduate/next-steps/check-application-status.aspx)

Although you have already been admitted, deferring your admission to another term
will not guarantee future admission. You must obtain permission from the program to
defer. Email your request directly to the graduate program to which you applied. The
request must be processed **within 12 months of your initial admission date** **and before the program’s application deadline for the upcoming term.**

[Contact My Program](http://www.grad.usf.edu/programs/search_all.php)

[Show Update of Admission Request](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/graduate/next-steps/check-application-status.aspx)

If an admission decision has not been offered and an applicant wants to be considered
for a future semester, that applicant must send a request to the Office of Admissions
asking them to update the application. The applicant must also specify their desired
term of enrollment. Applications are held for only 12 months. Email your update request
to the graduate program **within 12 months of the term you initially requested**. If you miss this deadline, you must submit a new application and fee. The Office
of Admissions will not process any update requests without first receiving all official
transcripts and required test scores.
