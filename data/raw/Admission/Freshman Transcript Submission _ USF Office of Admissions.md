## Freshman Transcript Submission

![University of South Florida's front entrance digital sign.](./Freshman Transcript Submission _ USF Office of Admissions_files/hs-transcript-submission-cms-header.jpg)

Students attending USF as an incoming freshman must submit transcripts to enroll at
the university. Below are definitions of the types of transcripts that may be requested
and how to complete the requirement.

---

### REQUIRED FOR:

#### **Complete Application**

You must submit either the **STARS or a partial high school transcript based on your residency status** to complete your application (along with your application fee and test scores) to
receive an admissions decision.

[Show U.S.-Based Students - Spring: Official High School Transcript](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/submit-transcripts.aspx)

U.S.-based students starting in the **spring** must submit final official high school transcripts for admission consideration. These
transcripts should reflect final grades and graduation date listed directly on the
doucment.

**The deadline to submit your final high school transcript for admission consideration
for spring is July 1.**

* Follow the instructions in the next section for submitting high school transcripts.
  Choose the instructions that match your school's location and type.

[Show U.S.-Based Students - Fall and Summer: STARS *(formerly SSAR/SRAR)*](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/submit-transcripts.aspx)

U.S.-based students starting in the **summer and fall** [must submit the STARS](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admission-information/ssar.aspx), not a partial transcript. You will self-report your grades through the STARS portal before
we can make an admissions decision.

[Show International Students: Partial High School Transcript](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/submit-transcripts.aspx)

Non-U.S.-based students must submit partial high school transcripts for admission
consideration. These transcripts reflect completed and in-progress courses but usually
don't include graduation dates or final completed courses.

* Follow the instructions in the next section for submitting partial high school transcripts.
  Choose the instructions that match your school's location and type.

#### **Final Enrollment at USF**

After graduation from high school, all incoming students must submit a [**final high school transcript**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/submit-transcripts.aspx#how-to) to USF as soon as possible.

[Show All Incoming Students: Final High School Transcript](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/submit-transcripts.aspx)

Regardless of residency status in the U.S., all incoming first-year students must
supply their final high school transcript after graduation. Your final high school
transcript must include your graduation date and all courses must be listed as completed.

* **Please note:** Students who are admitted to USF must submit their final official transcripts after
  graduation. USF admissions staff will use these transcripts to ensure the information
  on your STARS is accurate. Any inaccuracies could have the following consequences:

* + You could lose your admission to USF
  + Your scholarship could be reduced or rescinded
  + Your course registration may be canceled
* If you do not submit these documents by the deadline, your enrollment at the University
  of South Florida will be canceled. The deadlines for final transcript submission are:

* + **June 15** - Summer start
  + **July 15** - Fall start
* If your graduation date is close to or after our deadline, please reach out to us as soon as possible so we may help you with options.

**Please note:** The deadlines for final transcript submission are:

* **June 15** - Summer start
* **July 15** - Fall start

### How to Submit Transcripts

Incoming students should submit final transcripts electronically, using the University
of South Florida's school code **001537**. Follow the outlined options below for submission based on your school type.

Important notes for transcript submission:

* Contact your high school counselor promptly to request submission.
* Transcripts must be sent directly to USF from your school.
* Additionally, provide official final transcripts from any post-secondary institutions
  attended, such as dual enrollment.
* Allow 4-6 weeks for the USF Office of Admissions to process your transcript.

[Show Florida Public High Schools](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/submit-transcripts.aspx)

* **Preferred:** **FASTER/SPEEDE** – Contact your high school guidance counselor about submission through this provider.
  In order to submit transcripts through this provider, schools must have an active
  subscription. Make sure your high school guidance counselor is set up to facilitate
  this submission method.
* If your school does not partner with FASTER/SPEEDE, your high school guidance counselor
  should submit transcripts through one of these two providers:
  + [Scribbles Software](https://www.scribsoft.com/)
  + [SCOIR](https://www.scoir.com/)

[Show Florida Private High Schools](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/submit-transcripts.aspx)

* **Preferred:** [Parchment Exchange](https://exchange.parchment.com/u/auth/login) – You can directly request your transcript through the Parchment website. If you

[Show Florida Colleges and Universities](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/submit-transcripts.aspx)

* **Preferred: Electronic Data Interchange** - Request to transfer your final transcript directly through the institution you
  are attending/have attended. Typically, this process is handled by your college’s
  Office of the Registrar. If not, you can usually find the correct department by searching
  online for “Request Transcript” with the name of your institution.
* If you are unable to submit your transcript through the Electronic Data Interchange,
  you should work with your counselor to submit your transcripts through one of these
  providers instead:

  counselor should submit transcripts through one of these two providers instead:

  Evaluation Service.
