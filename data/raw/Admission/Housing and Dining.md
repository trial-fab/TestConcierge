## Housing and Dining

Housing options are limited. Students should allow 5-6 months prior to their arrival
to USF to research and select an on- or off- campus housing option that they believe
will be safe, convenient, and comfortable to them.

### Housing

#### On-Campus Options

Living on campus allows students to spend more time with their peers and to be closer
to the many academic, sports, cultural, and social events and activities on campus.
USF provides a safe community designed to help students excel both in-and-out of the
classroom.

Students are urged to submit their Housing application *as soon as possible*, as the rooms on-campus tend to fill up **very quickly**.

Please visit the [USF Housing and Residential website](https://www.usf.edu/housing/) for more information about the housing application and on-campus housing costs.

Students may contact the USF Housing and Residential Education team directly at housing@usf.edu with questions about on-campus housing. For more information about linking on-campus
at USF, please [watch the 'Living at USF' video](https://usfedu-my.sharepoint.com/%3Av%3A/g/personal/datp_usf_edu/Ec6oXe2FfC5CiuNtpwAC6cQBgcJV0rooB6G6cjLKmGui2Q?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJTdHJlYW1XZWJBcHAiLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJTaGFyZURpYWxvZy1MaW5rIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXcifX0%3D&e=Rp8URu).

# For Tampa Campus Students:

The Tampa campus has four types of housing, two convenience stores, three dining halls,
a variety of fast-food restaurants, several recreation facilities, and a mail/package
delivery service. The campus also has a massive library, computer labs, a student
center, as well as a police station to provide security.

# For St. Petersburg Campus Students:

For more information about on-campus options at the St. Petersburg campus, please
visit their [Housing and Residential Education site](https://www.stpetersburg.usf.edu/student-life/housing/index.aspx).

# For Sarasota-Manatee Campus Students:

The USF Sarasota-Manatee campus does not have any current on-campus or affiliated
housing options, but encourages students to [research the many available properties in the Sarasota and Manatee counties](https://www.sarasotamanatee.usf.edu/admissions/admitted-students/affiliated-housing.aspx).

#### Off-Campus Options

**Students should consider the following issues when selecting off-campus housing:**

1. Read and Understand the Lease: Students should always read a lease and agree to its
   terms **before** signing this legal contract. Students are encouraged to ask someone they trust about
   the terms of their lease agreement to ensure that they understand it.
2. Inspecting Rental Property: Students may also invite a trusted person to accompany
   them when inspecting the rental property. It is important to make note of any damage
   to the property before signing a lease.
3. Do NOT sign multiple leases. This includes signing both off-campus and on-campus housing
   leases. USF Housing will not allow students to breech a signed lease agreement if
   they sign an off-campus lease. Off-campus housing facilities will also not allow students
   to breech these legal contracts if they sign multiple leases.

##### Finding Off-Campus Housing

The [USF Off-Campus Housing](https://offcampushousing.usf.edu/) website lists available rental units and is a service provided by USF Student Government,
in contractual agreement with Off-Campus Partners, Inc. USF cannot recommend or endorse
any of the listed rental properties. This is simply a list of options that students
may consider when choosing off-campus housing.

##### Five Important Off-Campus Housing Tips

1. 1. Some apartment complexes require international students to provide a large deposit
      or to have a financial guarantor in the United States. This may be an additional off-campus
      housing expense for students.  Students should ask about the deposit amounts before
      signing a lease.
   2. Students should consider the distance from their off-campus housing to the university.
      Students may have additional transportation expenses the further away they are located
      from the campus. Also, students should consider the university’s safety training resources
      if they plan to walk or bicycle to campus.
   3. The Bull Runner is the USF bus system that provides free transport to all students
      with a valid USF ID Card. Students can find more information about the [Bull Runner here](https://www.usf.edu/parking/bull-runner/index.aspx). When choosing off-campus housing, students should consider the distance from their
      residence to a Bull Runner bus stop.
   4. Consider online reviews of property when choosing off-campus housing. These reviews
      are written by past and current tenants and can give an indication of the property’s
      living conditions.
   5. Students may use Google Maps and look at the “Street View” of property they are considering
      to rent. The Street View may give students a better indication of how the property
      looks in-person, rather than relying on edited gallery photos that may be included
      on apartment listing websites.

### DIning

From traditional dining halls to cafes and food courts, multiple Starbucks locations,
and more, there are many different dining options located on campus. USF campus dining
options cater for all dietary needs including vegan and vegetarian, gluten-free, Halal,
and more. Meal plans are required for Freshman students with an on-campus housing
reservation, but students who live off-campus may also sign-up for a meal plan if
they prefer.
