## Event Space

Our team gives students, staff, and faculty the privilege to utilize our space for
free in various USF events. Our event space encompasses the Global Student Center,
which occupies the first level of the Faculty Administration Office (FAO) building
on the Tampa campus.

### The FAO building

The Faculty Administration Office (FAO) building contains four main event spaces for
any type of occassion: the Lobby, Game Room, and two classrooms. The Game Room and
two classrooms have moveable furniture, overhead projectors with computer monitor
stands equipped with HDMI configurations. Each has a white or clear-board to draw
on with dry-erase markers.

* The FAO Lobby (FAO #100) spans the whole north-side of our building, catering to larger
  group activities, presentations, or large-social groups.
* The Game Room (FAO #127) is an informal space for social-events, conversations, and
  hangouts. The Game Room is looaded with comfy furniture, game systems, and physical
  board games great for any occasion.
* The Classrooms (FAO #102 and #104) are two, seperate classroom-configured spaces with
  movable tables and chairs that are great for e-board meetings, formal occassions,
  or group sessions.
