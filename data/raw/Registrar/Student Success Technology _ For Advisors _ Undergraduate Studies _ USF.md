## Student Success Technology

USF utilizes a variety of technology tools and resources to monitor undergraduate
student academic activity, to maintain records of outreach to students, to track progress
towards degree and to support the student course registration process. Open each section
to learn how to request access, login to the system, or report an issue.

#### Student Information System (Banner/OASIS)

Banner by Ellucian is the student information system for all student records at the
University of South Florida. As the primary system of record, most student transactions
are recorded in this system and include but are not limited to: Student Admissions,
Class Registration, Student Accounts Receivable, Financial Aid Processing, Transcript
Maintenance, Mid Term/ Final Grades, Academic History, and Graduation.

[Show Access and login information](https://www.usf.edu/undergrad/advisors/student-success-technology.aspx)

* How can faculty and staff request access to Banner?

Access to Banner for faculty and staff is managed by a number of different offices
in . You must first complete and pass the online Family Educational Rights & Privacy
Act (FERPA) tutorial and quiz[.](http://www.registrar.usf.edu/presentation/ferpa_quiz/ "FERPA tutorial and quiz") After completion, you must fully complete a “OASIS/Banner Access form” and which
Banner tables you need to access; this requires a written justification of business
use (e.g., why you need this information for your job and how it will be used) as
well as the approval of your supervisor. Please visit the “[Banner, BDM & Degree Works Access Request webpage](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/banner-access.aspx "SIS questions")” for more information.

* How can students access Banner?

Students access Banner information via OASIS which is available within your MyUSF
portal. And good news – no process is required for requesting access because it is
granted automatically once you become a student.

* How can I report an error when accessing or using Banner?

Issues with or errors within Banner should be emailed to help@usf.edu with “Banner” and the name of the Banner form in the subject line. Please include
a brief description of the issue or error as well as any screenshots (if possible).

#### DegreeWorks

DegreeWorks is a web-based, degree-auditing tool which enables students and advisors
to evaluate academic progress towards degree in accordance with state, university
and academic program requirements as listed in the Undergraduate Catalog. Currently
DegreeWorks is primarily utilized for undergraduate majors and minors, and does not
include certificates and graduate program (exception are the graduate programs in
the College of Public Health).

* Are there different types of access to DegreeWorks? How do I know what I need?

DegreeWorks does offer levels of access: read only and update; additionally, there
are two levels within update access. The majority of users have read only access.
Update access allows the users to make adjustments to a student’s audit and is reserved
for those with academic job responsibilities related to academic progression, graduation
certification and monitoring excess credit hours.

* How can staff and faculty login to DegreeWorks?

Go to [https://degreeworks.usf.edu](https://degreeworks.usf.edu/) and login with your USF NetID and password. If you have not received approval to
access the system, you will receive an error message.

* How can students access DegreeWorks?

Access Degree Works using the [hyperlink](https://degreeworks.usf.edu/) or on your MyUSF page under "Learning & Teaching Tools" with your activated USF NetID/password.

* I think there is something wrong on my/this DegreeWorks audit. What should I do?

Students should contact an academic advisor and review their DegreeWorks audit with
guidance before assuming there are errors.

**For faculty and staff:** Each academic college has a lead contact for DegreeWorks. Please communicate your
concern with that person for assistance in determining if there is an issue with a
degree audit; we suggest using the department or major email address to contact advising.
In the event that an error is uncovered, that staff person can work directly with
the appropriate IT personnel to request changes using approved channels.

#### Archivum Insights

Archivum Insights is one of the numerous applications housed within USF’s Archivum
platform. Insights contains the Student Success Dashboard, which serves as the home
for the university’s student success case management resources including comprehensive
notes system, referral process, and cases, as well as Advising Appointment Scheduling.
These resources are used by the Office of Academic Advocacy, academic advising, and
various offices across the Student Success unit.

[Show Access and login information](https://www.usf.edu/undergrad/advisors/student-success-technology.aspx)

* If I have access to Archivum Travel or other Archivum applications, do I need to request
  access again to use Insights?

route you to Archivum HomeSites. Insights is located within the “Staff” tile on the
landing page. Currently only limited faculty have use of Archivum Insights based on
administrative responsibilities.

* As a faculty member, I heard that I could share academic concerns about student success
  in my classes using Archivum. How can I do that without access?

Any faculty members can create a referral through their course(s) in Canvas to share
important information about a student’s academic progression. All Canvas Referrals
are stored within Archivum Insights for review by student success professionals. [Check out this brief video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27Hnq4wABDU) to learn how to submit a Canvas Referral!

* How do students access Archivum Insights?

While all students have access to dashboards like Appointment Scheduling or MyBulls
Path, students will not have access to Archivum Inisghts unless they have on-campus
jobs that require it to complete job responsibilities.

**NOTE:** Students are also required to successfully complete the online [Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act (FERPA) tutorial and quiz](https://registrar.ucla.edu/faculty-staff/ferpa/ferpa-tutorial-and-quiz) before using Archivum Insights.

these visualizations with existing technology tools and share insights via dashboards
and reports. Currently there are a handful of dashboards earmarked for use by academic
advising:

* Advising SMART dashboard: advanced dashboard on undergraduate student academic performance,
* the Finish in Four reporting suite: multiple dashboard providing end users with better
  tracking of undergraduate FTIC students’ trajectory during their fourth year of enrollment,
* XTRANS report: compliance reporting to review the use of the XTRANS attribute for
  audit purposes, and
* Archivum appointment data: trend information on scheduled and drop-in appointments.

#### SIS Reports (SAP/Live Banner data)

SAP is the reporting platform that USF uses to produce analytical and ad hoc reporting
with live Banner data to assist university personnel with operational data and in
facilitating university initiatives. Several reports are used by academic advising,
examples include but are not limited to: Midterm grades, final grades, permits, current
students, D/F/W reports, graduation application, probation, holds, and others. This
system replaced the previous WRS reports.

[Show Access and login information](https://www.usf.edu/undergrad/advisors/student-success-technology.aspx)

* How do faculty and staff request access to SAP?

For access to SAP, you and your supervisor should complete and sign the SISReports
Access Form located on the [ODS website](https://academicplanning.usf.edu/Internal/OperationalReporting/SapAccessRequest) and send to SISReports@usf.edu.  You will need to complete FERPA training and provide proof before your form is
processed by IT. Similarly to Banner and DegreeWorks, access to various reports is
approved by different offices. If any one level of access is denied by a Data Owner,
then you must complete a new request form and omit the role that was denied to obtain
access to the other areas.

**NOTE:** If you’re unsure about what you should request in SAP, review the “SIS-SAP Reports
Master List” linked on the [ODS website](https://usf.app.box.com/s/w3w20isg4ipp4ajkgui15eu2hmmm8sr9) to review available options.

expedite a resolution.

#### eScheduler (Limited Use)

eScheduler is a web-based appointment scheduling tool that interfaces directly with
USF staff’s Outlook calendar to provide students with real-time options for availability.
Currently only inactive USF students or prospective USF students use eScheduler to
schedule academic advising appointments located in the colleges. Active students needing
academic advising appointments should schedule online using Archivum Appointment Scheduling.
Students can use eScheduler to book appointments with other student services offices
such as Education Abroad, INTO, the Office of National Scholars and Veterans Success.

Any user needing access to eScheduler or that experiences difficulty or errors when
using the tool should send an email to help@usf.edu with “eScheduler” in the subject line.

#### Civitas (discontinued)

USF has discontinued use of the suite of Civitas products (Illume, Inspire, Courses
and Insights). Advisors seeking data insights on student academic performance should
refer to the suite of reporting tools available via Power BI.

#### Schedule Planner aka College Scheduler (discontinued)

Based on student feedback on Schedule Planner, USF has retired the application. Registration
will now be completed through OASIS. Log in through MyUSF to view your registration
appointment time and prepare to register for classes through OASIS following the steps
and using the helpful resources below.
