## Registration

Students should work with their academic advisor in the process of selecting courses
for their schedule. Meeting with an advisor ensures that you are taking the appropriate
courses for your degree each term, and will keep you on the most efficient path towards
graduation. [Contact your College to schedule an advising appointment.](https://www.usf.edu/undergrad/students/advising-offices.aspx)

Course registration is completed through [MyUSF](http://my.usf.edu/). Log in to view your registration appointment time and prepare to register for classes
through OASIS following the steps and using the helpful resources below.

The University of South Florida is a single university with a fully aligned and integrated
curriculum and a single set of academic policies and procedures. As of July 1, 2020,
all students can register for any courses at Tampa, St. Petersburg and Sarasota-Manatee
campus locations to complete degree requirements. Students looking for online courses
are highly encouraged to search the offerings of all three campuses.

#### Permits

Some courses are restricted due to pre-requisite requirements or class standing (sophomore,
junior, etc.) requiring permission (or a permit) to register.  In some cases you will
see a message in Schedule Planner indicating a permit is required.  Or you will receive
an error message stating "Pre-Reg/Test Score Error," or "Class Restriction." For more
information on permits university-wide, please use this link:  <https://www.usf.edu/registrar/permit.aspx>.

Please use this link to request a permit for courses managed by the Office of Undergraduate
Studies: [UGS Permit Request Link](https://usf.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3sfuMAtuluplIUZ)
