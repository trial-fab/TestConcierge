[Show SLS 2901 Academic Foundations Seminar](https://www.usf.edu/undergrad/academic-foundations/first-year-students.aspx)

Academic Foundations SLS 2901 is a three-credit, discussion-based introductory seminar
designed to facilitate students' successful acclimation to the university and development
of academic strategies. The course aims to prepare students for a successful college
experience and provides students with the necessary knowledge and experiences to be
academically and personally success at USF.
Each class consists of approximately 30 students and is taught by a caring and committed
instructor. The course is built around the themes of developing effective academic
skills, creating academic, career, and financial plans, and demonstrating knowledge,
skills, and abilities.

Academic Foundations is a flipped class. This means students will complete readings,
videos, quizzes, and homework BEFORE coming to class. Our time in class will be spent
practicing, applying, and using students' knowledge and skills. During class time,
students will spent time interacting and working together in small and large groups,
helping to build their relationships with other first-year students.

#### Course topics:

* How Learning & Memory Work
* Approaches to Learning & Study Strategies
* Mindset & Motivation
* Degree Planning & Academics at USF
* Career Planning & Readiness
* Critical Thinking
* Argumentation
* Communication
* Research Skills
* Managing Time & Money

We hope Academic Foundations will become a valuable beginning to your college experience
at the University of South Florida!
