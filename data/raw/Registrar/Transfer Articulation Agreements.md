## Transfer Articulation Agreements

[USF Policy 10-068](https://usf.app.box.com/v/usfpolicy10-068) requires institutions to publically disclose their transfer of credit policies to
prospective and enrolled students. This disclosure must include any established criteria
USF uses regarding the transfer of credit earned at another institution and a list
of institutions with which USF has established an articulation agreement.

Dual Enrollment Agreements: Information on Dual Enrollment agreements can be viewed
on the [Early University & Dual Enrollment](https://www.usf.edu/early-university-programs/dual-enrollment/) page.

Statewide Articulation Agreements: These are entered into at the state level, rather
than directly between USF and another school or institution.

* [Statewide Articulation](https://www.fldoe.org/schools/higher-ed/fl-college-system/dual-enroll-transfer/postsecondary-articulation.stml#:~:text=Florida%E2%80%99s%20Statewide%20Articulation%20Agreement%20%282%2B2%29%20allows%20grants%20students,University%20System%20of%20Florida%E2%80%99s%2012%20public%20state%20universities.)
* [Career and Technical Education Statewide Agreements](https://www.fldoe.org/academics/career-adult-edu/career-technical-edu-agreements/)

**Please note:** An audit of all agreements is currently under review to determine if termination
or revision is required.

Questions or concerns about an agreement may be directed to ugs-dean@usf.edu.
