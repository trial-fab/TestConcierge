## Instructors

Our courses are taught by caring campus professionals who are committed to student
success.

Instructors create opportunities for first year students to practice academic skills,
explore their major and future career, meet new people and develop relationships,
and learn skills to manage the transition to a college learning environment. Throughout
the course, instructors challenge students to actively participate in the learning
process and thoughtfully practice and assess their skills.
