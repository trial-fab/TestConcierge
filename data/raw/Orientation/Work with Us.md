#### Collaboration

We love to collaborate not only with with USF Departments and USF-affiliated groups,
but also with USF Student Groups to help support and recognize international students.

ISS partners with campus departments and local organizations to host events, such
as Hurricane Awareness aimed at educating both international and domstic students
on storm preparedness.

We also coordinate initiatives such as International Culture Exchange and De-Stress
Fest to promote student well being and conversations about our various backgrounds.
