#### Recruitment

[Show What do I do as an Orientation Leader?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

Great question! Orientation Leaders help provide new students and their families with
a seamless transition to the University of South Florida. As an Orientation Leader,
you will be working with students from different demographics such as Transfer, First
Year, and International along with their families and guests. We suggest thoroughly
reading the position’s Information Packet. This outlines position benefits, descriptions,
and a list of sample various dates and commitments to keep in mind.

[Show Do I have to be a first year student to apply for the Orientation Leader role?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

No – any student can apply! However, you do have to be a current, full-time, undergraduate
student to be eligible with a graduation date of Fall 2026 or later.

[Show Where can I access the Orientation Leader application?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

You can access the Orientation Leader position [here](https://usf.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9oQKhZaOVLuvyYK).

No, but it can help! New Student and Family Engagement is looking for all kinds of
students, personalities, and experiences. Our Orientation Leader positions are designed
intentionally to help students learn and grow.

[Show Will the Summer 2026 Orientation sessions be virtual or in-person?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

in-person and virtual Orientation sessions.

#### Application

[Show Do I need to submit a resume?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

No, resumes are not necessary. However, while previous experience is not required
for the Orientation Leader position, the online application will require you to answer
a few questions regarding: any previous employment, campus or community organizations
you may be currently involved in, any leadership positions you may have held within
those organizations, leadership training (retreats/conferences) you have participated
in, and why you are interested in the Orientation Leader position.

[Show What should I put for my GPA on the application if I do not have a USF GPA?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

If you do not have a USF GPA, please use your most recent GPA from a previous institution
(e.g., high school, previous college, university, state school, etc.).

[Show What is the purpose of the OL application video?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

The video is your chance to showcase your personality, energy, and passion for the
role! It helps us see how you engage with others, confidence with public speaking,
and the enthusiasm you would bring as an Orientation Leader. Think of it as a way
for us to get a sense of who you are beyond your written responses.

#### Interviews

[Show What is the best way to prepare for the interviews?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

Reflect on experiences that demonstrate your leadership, teamwork, and ability to
build community. Be prepared to share specific examples and show your enthusiasm for
the role. We also suggest familiarizing yourself with the Orientation Leader information
packet.

[Show What should I wear to the Individual Interview?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

We expect attire that is comfortable and appropriate—think “dress your best” style.

[Show What if I can’t attend the Individual Interviews?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

If you are unable to attend your scheduled interview, please contact us as soon as
possible at **myorientation@usf.edu**. We may be able to offer an alternative time, but space is limited, so early communication
is important.

[Show What happens if I don’t sign up for an interview on time?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

Interviews are required to be considered for the role. If you do not sign up by the

encourage you to register on time.

[Show Will I know the questions beforehand?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

on your experiences and think about how you demonstrate leadership, teamwork, and
community-building skills.

Orientation Leaders. You’ll answer a few questions about your experiences and skills,
and it’s a chance for us to get to know you while you learn more about the role.

#### General / Job Related

[Show What types of characteristics or abilities are you looking for in the Orientation
Leader candidates?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

We look for candidates who are enthusiastic, approachable, and committed to building
community. Strong communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills are important,
as well as the ability to support and engage with new students in a welcoming way.

[Show What if I must miss an Orientation session over the summer?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

When you apply, you are committing to all the dates. If you are already aware of an
obligation that will mean missing a session, please tell Orientation staff before
accepting the role. If we are unable to work through the conflict with you, we suggest
you consider applying for the Orientation Leader role in a future year.

[Show Can I take summer classes?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

Yes! You can take summer classes online at USF as long as the courses you want are
offered in an online, asynchronous format. Make sure to check course availability
in the USF Course Catalog, confirm any registration rules with your advisor, and plan
your schedule carefully! If hired, you will be expected to communicate your intended
class schedule with your supervisor before registering.

[Show Can I have another job while in the role of an Orientation Leader?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

Yes, you may have another job; however, it’s important to ensure your schedule allows
you to fully participate in all Orientation Leader responsibilities, including trainings,
events, and student sessions. Time management is key to balancing multiple commitments.

[Show Can I travel in the summer?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

It depends. The Orientation Leader position has various dates of commitment that you
should be aware before moving forward with any travel plans. While there are some
breaks over the summer for Orientation Leaders to make travel plans, we expect the
Orientation Leader position to be the priority and you will not be allowed to miss
Orientation Leader commitments for traveling.

[Show Can I be a Resident Assistant and an Orientation Leader at the same time?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

Yes! However, your Orientation Leader contract would end early to make sure you are
able to attend Resident Assistant training and associated commitments (see the example
of the listed “Dates and Commitments” pages of the Information Packets to have an
idea how your summer will look). You are not permitted to be a summer RA.

[Show Are Orientation Leaders hired for just the summer, or do they work during the school
year as well?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

Orientation Leaders are contracted from January 2026 to January 2027. All OLs are
required to attend a Spring 2025 leadership training, which begins the second week
of the Spring semester. While most responsibilities occur during the summer, OLs will
also participate in Fall 2026 recruitment events and other team activities. Refer
to the “Dates and Commitments” section of the Information Packet for a detailed overview
of how your time will be spent.

[Show During the summer, what's a typical work week like for Orientation Leaders?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

During the summer, Orientation Leaders typically work 3–4 student sessions per week,
Monday through Friday. Schedules may also include trainings, team meetings, and preparation
time, with hours varying depending on session times and events. OLs typically work
full days when sessions are in progress.

[Show What is the Orientation Leader training process like? What will be covered?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

In the Spring Leadership Training, we will focus on team building, connecting with
other Orientation Leaders, and introducing you to the roles and functions of our department.

In our May Training period, we will expand on concepts from spring training, but also
cover USF information, campus resources, customer service, storytelling, how to facilitate
small group discussions, Orientation procedures, session logistics, and much, much
more!

[Show Is this job paid?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

Yes, the Orientation Leader job is paid an hourly rate of $14.00/hour.

[Show What will my housing accommodation look like over the 2026 summer?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/contact-us/meet-the-team.aspx)

On-campus housing will be available for OLs that are in need of summer housing. More
information will be shared if you are invited to an Individual Interview in October.
If you are in need of housing for Summer 2026 in order to perform the responsibilities
of being an Orientation Leader, please indicate this on your application (This will
not impact our decision in any way).
