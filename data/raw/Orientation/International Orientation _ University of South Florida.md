# USF International Orientation

Congratulations on your acceptance to USF!

## Welcome

USF offers a dynamic learning environment that inspires innovation and creativity
and — most importantly — is focused on your success. Our Orientation program is designed
to prepare you for being a student at USF and living in the U.S. We have worked closely
with current USF international students to design an Orientation program specific
to the needs of international students like you! During your Orientation, you will
interact with current Bulls, hear about USF resources, speak with an academic advisor
and learn ways to get involved on campus.

**Please note:** The Glo-Bull Beginnings International Orientation is only available at the Tampa
campus. If you are attending the St. Petersburg or Sarasota-Manatee campuses, you
will reserve a standard Orientation date.

## Orientation Steps

The University of South Florida Orientation experience is hosted in-person, on campus
and virtually. Attendance is required. All first-year and transfer undergraduate students
admitted to USF will be required to complete three parts of the Orientation experience.

#### Step 1: Make Your Reservation

Check your USF email and complete the academic program requirements for your respective
academic college. **Please note**: In some cases, this can be completed after the in-person Orientation session.

#### Step 3: Attend Orientation Session

First-Year Students: You are required to arrive in person at the Tampa campus and
be visible for the whole program. This experience will include a time for students
to participate in educational sessions, which will assist in their transition into
the university community, complete their new student journey including picking up
their ID card, clearing holds and more. Please make sure to check your USF email for
more details.

Transfer Students: You are required to attend a virtual or in-person Orientation experience.
This program allows students to engage with a group of other incoming undergraduate
transfer students and receive important information that is best delivered in a small
group or discussion-based format. To participate in the Orientation, students will
need to be logged into Microsoft Teams with their USF NetID and password. If you encounter
any trouble, email USF Information Technology for assistance at help@usf.edu.

Be sure to continue checking your USF email, as you will receive additional details
to prepare for your arrival prior to Orientation. Do not hesitate to reach out to
our office by calling 813-974-3060 or emailing us at myorientation@usf.edu.

#### General Questions

[Show Why is there an Orientation fee?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

New undergraduate students are required to pay a $35 fee to attend Orientation upon
making a reservation. Additional charges may apply for families and guests who choose
to attend Orientation. The fee goes toward covering the costs of providing the full
Orientation experience to students, including facility rentals, meals, staffing and
necessary services and expenses to ensure a successful start. If you’re experiencing
financial difficulties, please contact us at myorientation@usf.edu.

[Show What if I am unable to attend any of the Orientation sessions?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

Orientation is mandatory for all new students at the University of South Florida.
We strongly encourage anyone who has concerns about being able to attend an Orientation
session to call us immediately at 813-974-3060. Additionally, you might consider updating your term of entry to a later term to
allow you to attend a later Orientation. To do this, you would need to contact the
Office of Undergraduate Admissions at 813-974-3350.

[Show How do I request ADA accommodations to attend Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

Orientation strives to provide the same experience to all participants. In compliance
with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), we provide special accommodations
to students and guests who require this to participate in the session. Requests are
often submitted for assistance with mobility, vision or hearing issues.

#### Travel and Arrival

[Show Where can I stay during Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

There is a hotel on campus where students and their families/guests are encouraged
to stay during their Orientation experiences. For more information, please refer to
the contact information below:

**Embassy Suites USF Hotel**
3705 Spectrum Blvd, Tampa, FL 33612
**Phone**: 813-977-7066
**Website**: [http://embassysuitesUSF.com](http://embassysuitesusf.com/)

[Show Where should my arrival location be?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

When booking your travel, we strongly recommend that your travel itinerary concludes
at Tampa International Airport (TPA). However, you will likely arrive in the United
States through another airport such as Miami International Airport (MIA), New York
John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) or San Francisco International Airport
(SFO). If your itinerary includes a layover at another U.S. airport, such as the ones
above, you should allow at least three or four hours for Customs and Immigration processing
prior to your next flight time.

Travel Suggestion: Domestic U.S. carriers (such as Southwest Airlines or JetBlue Airways)
may offer more competitive pricing for your flight to TPA once you arrive in the United
States. You may want to compare prices for the flight from your port of entry to TPA.

[Show How should I travel to campus?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

If you prefer to arrange for your transportation upon arrival, a shuttle service and
taxis are available at all area airports in the baggage claim area. For current costs
and transportation options at Tampa International Airport, visit the TPA website’s
[Ground Transportation](http://www.tampaairport.com/ground-transportation) information.

####

#### Reservation Information

[Show How do I change information on my Orientation reservation or choose another date?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

You can make changes to your reservation details and/or add guests by logging into
your MyOrientation account. Refunds are not issued for students or guests who do not
show up to their scheduled sessions. Further, reservations changed within three business
days of a session or due to “no show” status may be subject to a $25 late/no show
fee.

[Show Can I change my major before I attend Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

To change your major, you must submit an [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/international/next-steps/international-forms.aspx). You must also express your reason for changing your major when you contact your
college.

***Please note:** Many academic programs at USF are limited-access majors that require very specific
courses and credits in order to be admitted to these majors. We strongly recommend
that you speak with an admissions recruiter prior to submitting the [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/international/next-steps/international-forms.aspx).*

[Show I am admitted to USF but will not be attending this semester. Who do I contact?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

You should notify ***both*** the Office of Orientation by calling 813-974-3060 and the Office of Admissions by submitting an [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/international/next-steps/international-forms.aspx). Application Update Forms can take up to two weeks to process.

[Show I don't see any available dates. What do I do?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

While this rarely occurs, it could be due to several reasons. To troubleshoot this
issue, please contact our office at myorientation@usf.edu or 813-974-3060. We will work with you to resolve the issue.

[Show Can family members or guests attend Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

Families and guests of incoming USF International students will be given the option
to register for a supplemental Family and Guest Orientation Session.  Your Orientation
experience will be made up of an in-person, on-campus experience as well as online
Orientation content via Canvas Catalog.

**In-person, on-campus Orientation program**

During your scheduled Orientation session, you’ll join the Orientation Team and other
USF Campus Partners for a full-day event on all things USF. Campus Partners and Orientation
Leaders will guide you throughout the day, providing key university information and
ways for you to support your student during their transition to USF.

**Online content via The Parent and Family Bulletin**

The Parent and Family Bulletin has a wealth of content for families and guests about
USF resources that will help you support your student during their academic journey.
Families and guests can log in and access the content at their own pace. We encourage
families and guests to access their profile at [usf.campusesp.com.](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/parents/)

***Please note:** Live Synchronous (Virtual) Orientation sessions for transfer students do not have
a family and guest component. First-year and Transfer in-person, on-campus Orientation
sessions have a family and guest component.*

[Show How can a family member or guest be added to an Orientation session?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

Students may add a family member/guest to attend the Family/Guest Orientation session
by logging back into their Orientation reservation by 10 a.m. on their desired session
date. Log into your student reservation with your NetID and password, scroll to the
section that states “Add a Guest” and pay the additional $35 fee per family member.
Once reservations are closed, a family member or guest may contact the Office of Orientation
via email or phone to be added to the session date.

####

#### Payments

[Show Can I pay for Orientation with check or money order?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

While we prefer that you pay for your Orientation with a credit card or e-Check, we
can accept checks or money orders. Student reservations are not confirmed until payment
is received, so please note that this method will delay your confirmation.

To pay with a check or money order, please log into your Orientation reservation and
complete the reservation process up to the point of submitting payment. Then, complete
the [Cashier Payment Form](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/documents/cashiers-form_2020-v4.pdf) and mail it to the address listed on the form. You should also then email myorientation@usf.edu to let us know that you submitted payment. We will need to manually confirm your
reservation.

[Show Can I charge my Orientation fee to my student account?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

Students choosing this option of payment are fully responsible for the Orientation
fees. Financial aid may or may not cover these charges. By submitting [this form](https://form.jotform.com/92815011621144), the student agrees to pay Orientation fees within other University tuition and fee
deadlines.

At this time guest fees will not be charged to a student’s account. Guests may register
and pay for Orientation at any time including check-in (if space is available).

[Show Is it possible to obtain a refund for an Orientation session?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

Refunds are available only in specific situations. Click [here](https://usfweb.usf.edu/orientation/refundrequest.aspx) to request a refund. For more information, contact our office.

####

#### Preparing for Orientation Day

[Show How do I print my Orientation parking permit?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

During the reservation process, you were given the opportunity for a parking permit
for each student and guest. The parking permit will be included in your e-confirmation
packet. If you do not have your e-confirmation packet, log back into your MyOrientation
account and download the PDF from the My Reservation tab.

***Please note:** Your parking permit can only be found in your reservation for Orientation, so please
make sure to log back into your Orientation account to access the permit.*

If you did not receive a parking permit in your e-confirmation packet, you can log
into your Orientation reservation and request a permit under the Student tab or for
a guest under the Guests tab.

[Show Do I have to bring my unofficial transcripts with me to Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

Knowing the specific classes you have taken and/or being able to provide an expected
AP/IB score will assist in choosing the right classes. To support this, we encourage
you to bring your unofficial transcripts with you to Orientation to assist you with
your course registration. However, this is not required. An unofficial transcript
can be a document from your high school/college or something you print from your school’s
online site.

Bringing unofficial transcripts is especially important for students starting in the
summer when final transcripts are not yet available. Your academic advisor will work
with you if your final transcripts or scores later indicate a change that impacts
your pre-requisites.

[Show What technology is needed to attend a virtual Orientation session?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

To ensure you have a seamless virtual session day, please be sure that you have access
to:

* Reliable Internet Connection
* Laptop or Desktop Computer
* Webcam and Microphone
* Access to Microsoft Teams

If you cannot access any of these required items, please contact the Office of Orientation
immediately by emailing us at myorientation@usf.edu.

will have their admission canceled. Use the [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/international/next-steps/international-forms.aspx) when requesting changes to your original application information, such as term of
entry, major or campus, or when submitting changes in contact information. Be sure
to submit this form by the application deadline of the term in which you wish to enroll.

[Show How is Glo-Bull Beginnings (International Orientation) different from Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/international/)

Glo-Bull Beginnings is a program for undergraduate, international students to prepare
them for being a student at USF and living in the U.S. Glo-Bull Beginnings is your
opportunity to experience what it’s like to be a USF student, both in and out of the
classroom. In addition, this program will prepare you, as an international student,

task list. You will need to complete most of this information before you leave to
travel to the U.S. During Glo-Bull Beginnings, you will attend a Document Check where
International Services will need your travel documents and will verify that all information
is complete.
