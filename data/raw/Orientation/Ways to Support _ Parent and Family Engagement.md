## Ways to Support

As the parent or family member of a USF student, we want to make sure you have the
support you need to help your student be successful and earn their degree. We are
proud to serve parents, guardians, grandparents, spouses/partners, and any other supportive
people in the lives of our students. USF Families enjoy the following benefits and
services free of charge, provided by the Office of Parent and Family Engagement on
the Tampa campus:

1. [Parent & Family BULLetin](http://usf.campusesp.com/signup): Is a platform and e-newsletter for family members on the Tampa campus that provides
   ongoing campus updates on student life, support services, upcoming events and deadlines,
   and family-specific resources. Hundreds of resources are available to support your
   student’s continued enrollment and success. [Activate your profile](http://usf.campusesp.com/signup) today to customize your experience to receive the types of information you want at
   the frequency that works best for you and your family.
2. **Online resources:** Includes the Parent and Family Engagement [website](http://usf.edu/families) and [Facebook page](http://facebook.com/usfparents)
3. **Access to campus professionals/full-time staff:** Staff in the Office of Parent and Family Engagement have decades of experience assisting
   students and family members. Contact us any time via our [coaching form](http://tinyurl.com/usffamilyintake) or by phone at 813-974-2896.

The Office of Parent and Family Engagement is a revenue-funded unit that is expected
to generate funds to cover our operating expenses and events we host. As such, families
are asked to cover the cost of some experiences and offerings provided by our unit.
These include campus events such as [Family and Friends Weekend](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/parents/engage/family-friends-weekend.aspx), as well as the sale of [family and student merchandise](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/parents/engage/familymerch.aspx "family and student merchandise") at various points in the year.

### further support the student and family experience

**Purchase your Bull Family Pride Pack!**
There is nothing better than being part of the Bull Family and supporting your student
and USF with PRIDE! Each year, Parent & Family Engagement creates a [Bull Family Pride Pack](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/parents/engage/familymerch.aspx)to sport your USF pride wherever you go. Every Bull Family Pride Pack includes an
exclusive Bull family design on a t-shirt, tote bag, and water bottle made especially
for our USF families. Proceeds will directly benefit the Office of Parent & Family
Engagement to enhance our services to you and your student. [Click here](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/parents/engage/familymerch.aspx) to learn more about this year's Bull Family Pride Pack and how to order yours while
supplies last!

**Give to the USF Parent & Family Fund**Parent and Family Engagement programs and services are made possible by generous parents
and families who donate to the [Parent & Family Fund](https://giving.usf.edu/online/gift/f/590013/). Your gift of any size allows us to subsidize and support these ever-growing programs
for families and students.

*Corporate Matching:* Many employers sponsor matching gift programs and will match charitable contributions
made by their employees. Some companies also match retirees' or spouses' gifts. To
find out if your company has a matching gift program, please visit our [Matching Gifts](https://giving.usf.edu/how/matching-gifts) page.

**Sponsorship Opportunities**The Office of Parent & Family Engagement offers sponsorship opportunities for third
party organizations who would like to support our programs and who have an interest
in reaching our student and family audience. If you would like to learn more, please
email family@usf.edu.
