## Employment Based Visa Sponsorship (EBVS)

### H1B, 0-1, and TN (in US) Process at USF

**![EBVS Process Flow Chart](./International Services _ Employment Based Visa Sponsorship (EBVS)_files/ebvs-process.png)**

### Quick start instructions

**Step 1** – Get Department Permission to iStart (if you already have this move to step 2)
**Step 2** – If the incoming employee has a USF U#, go to Step 3. Otherwise, get the incoming
employee’s full name, date of birth, gender, and email (not from 125.com, 126.com)
to complete the Add New Person eform.
**Step 3** – Complete EBVS Initial Review
**Step 4** – after initial Review approval, complete remaining eforms.

> ### Complete Instructions

**The Employment Based Visa Sponsorship (EBVS) process is on online processing initiated
by the USF hiring department.**

1. Determine who the ‘department contact’ will be. The department contact is the person
   who will be responsible for logging into iStart and going through the online EBVS
   process. It might be a department administrator or the hiring supervisor.  Remember
   that the department contact will also work with USF’s Designated Counsel (law firm).
2. The department contact will [log in](https://istart.usf.edu/ "log in"). We suggest creating a bookmark in your browser.
3. If it is the first time the department contact has logged in, they will fill out the
   Department Permission Request Form and then email INTLEmployee@usf.edu to let us know they have applied.
4. Once we approve their request, the department contact [should log back in](https://istart.usf.edu/ "should log back in") and begin the application process.
5. The first eform is for initial review to determine if the proposed position is eligible
   for the requested visa .  The department will upload the position description. **NOTE**:  to complete this first eform, you need the employee’s USF U# and Date of birth
   OR a temporary ID.  To create a temporary ID go to Add New Person.
6. If approved, the department will continue to complete these eforms:
   1. Export Control – USF export control will determine if an export control license is
      required for  employee to engage in their job duties.
   2. Visa Sponsorship Authorization – the department will provide the employee’s full name,
      email address, current location, current immigration status, and other details necessary
      to initiate the case.
   3. Final Approval Signatures – the employee’s supervisor, department head, and Dean/VP,
      will be required to sign off on the request. All signatories must be USF employees
      as listed in USF’s HR database and have the ability to sign into the eforms using
      their USF Net ID. Requests from USF Health are forwarded to the appropriate USF Health
      Vice President.
7. Once the request is approved, the following may occur:
   1. For H-1B and O-1 cases, an email will initiate the case by connecting the department
      contact with the law firm.  The law firm will proceed with the case and will contact
      the employee for additional information.
   2. For TN cases, if the employee is travelling to Canada or Mexico, OIS will issue the
      TN letter to the employee.  If the employee is applying for a change of status, an
      email will initiate the case by connecting the department contact with the law firm.
      The law firm will proceed with the case and contact the employee for additional information.
   3. For E-3 cases, an email will initiate the case by connecting the department with the
      law firm.  The law firm will complete the Labor Certification and provide the employee
      with the E-3 packet for their travel or will proceed with the change of status case.
