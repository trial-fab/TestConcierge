## Meet the Team

# We look forward to welcoming you in-person and assisting you through out your journey at USF.

As your International Student Support (ISS) Team, we are here to support you through
your pre-arrival requirements, which may include tasks related to immunizations, health
insurance, housing, and orientation. Our aim is to help you resolve all these requirements,
so that you can register for classes and move-in to your university life without any
problems.

When you arrive at USF, your International Student Support Team will also be instrumental
in linking you to information and services on-campus and in the Tampa Bay area to
help you adapt to the university environment and thrive as a student.
