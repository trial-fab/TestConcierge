for first-year students to feel confident and connected before starting their college
journey. During this interactive experience, you’ll engage in educational sessions
designed to help you transition into the USF community. You’ll also complete campus
business, including picking up your ID card, clearing holds, getting a tour of the
university and more. Plus, you’ll have the opportunity to connect with new incoming
students and build connections prior to the start of your first semester.

New undergraduate students are required to pay a $35 fee to attend Orientation upon
making a reservation. Additional charges may apply for families and guests who choose
to attend Orientation. The fee goes toward covering the costs of providing the full
Orientation experience to students, including facility rentals, meals, staffing and
necessary services and expenses to ensure a successful start. If you’re experiencing
financial difficulties, please contact us at sar-orientation@usf.edu.

[Show What if I am unable to attend any of the Orientation sessions?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

Orientation is mandatory for all new students at the University of South Florida.
We strongly encourage anyone who has concerns about being able to attend an Orientation
session to call us immediately at 941-359-4342. Additionally, you might consider updating your term of entry to a later term to
allow you to attend a later orientation. To do this, you would need to contact the
Office of Undergraduate Admissions at 813-974-3350.

[Show How do I request ADA accommodations to attend Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

Orientation strives to provide the same experience to all participants.

In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), we provide special accommodations
to students and guests who require this to participate in the session. Requests are
often submitted for assistance with mobility, vision or hearing issues.

If you need any type of accommodation during your session, please email sar-orientation@usf.edu so we can ensure that all your needs are met. Requests should be submitted at least
14 business days prior to your session. In cases of emergency situations, we will
do our best to meet your needs.

[Show Can families and guests attend Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

Family and guests are invited to attend in-person orientations at the family and guest
rate. To best support families and guests of students, we provide valuable resources
at Orientation and will be open and available to answer any questions that you may
have. As a family or guest, even if you decide not to join us for Orientation, we
encourage you to review our USF [Bull Family Connect](https://www.collegiateparent.com/bull-family-connect/) guide. It includes helpful information to connect you to relevant campus and university
resources. Should you have any questions or concerns, please contact our office by
emailing us or by calling 941-359-4342.

* A pen (for notetaking)
* A sweater or jacket (the A/C can get cold)
* An umbrella (Florida weather can be unpredictable!)

#### First-Year Students

[Show Can I stay in a residence hall the night before my Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

The Office of Orientation does not provide overnight accommodations.

#### Payments

[Show Can I pay for Orientation with check or money order?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

While we prefer that you pay for your Orientation with a credit card or e-Check, we
can accept checks or money orders. Student reservations are not confirmed until payment
is received, so please note that this method will delay your confirmation.

To pay with a check or money order, please log into your [Orientation reservation](https://secure.vzorientation.com/usf/signin.aspx) and complete the reservation process up to the point of submitting payment. Then,
complete the [Cashier Payment Form](https://usf.edu/orientation/documents/cashiers-form_2020-v4.pdf) and mail it to the address listed on the form. You should also then email sar-orientation@usf.edu to let us know that you submitted payment. We will need to manually confirm your
reservation.

[Show Can I charge my Orientation fee to my student account?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

Students choosing this option of payment are fully responsible for the Orientation
fees. Financial aid may or may not cover these charges. The student agrees to pay
Orientation fees within other University tuition and fee deadlines. Please email sar-orientation@usf.edu to request the Orientation fee be charged to your student account.

At this time guest fees will not be charged to a student’s account. Guests may register
and pay for Orientation at any time including check-in (if space is available).

[Show Is it possible to obtain a refund for an Orientation session?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

Refunds are available only in specific situations. Please email sar-orientation@usf.edu to make a refund request. For more information, contact our office.

#### Preparing for Orientation Day

[Show How do I print my Orientation parking permit?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

If a parking permit is required for your session, you will receive instructions in
the orientation session reminder email prior to your session date.

[Show Do I have to bring my unofficial transcripts with me to Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

Knowing the specific classes you have taken and/or being able to provide an expected
AP/IB score will assist in choosing the right classes. To support this, we encourage
you to bring your unofficial transcripts with you to Orientation to assist you with
your course registration. However, this is not required. An unofficial transcript
can be a document from your high school/college or something you print from your school’s
online site.

Bringing unofficial transcripts is especially important for students starting in the
summer when final transcripts are not yet available. Your academic advisor will work
with you if your final transcripts or scores later indicate a change that impacts
your prerequisites.

#### Reservation Information

[Show How do I change information on my Orientation reservation or choose another date?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

You can make changes to your reservation details and/or add guests by logging into
your [MyOrientation account](https://secure.vzorientation.com/usf/signin.aspx). Refunds are not issued for students or guests who do not show up to their scheduled
sessions. Further, reservations changed within three business days of a session or
due to "no show" status may be subject to a $25 late/no show fee.

[Show Can I change my major before I attend Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

To change your major, you must submit an [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/freshmen-forms.aspx) in your Applicant Portal.

***Please note: Many academic programs at USF are** limited-access majors that require very specific courses and credits in order to
be admitted to these majors. We strongly recommend that you speak with an admissions recruiter prior to submitting the [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/freshmen-forms.aspx).*

[Show I am admitted to USF but will not be attending this semester. Who do I contact?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

You should notify both the Office of Orientation at 941-359-4342 or sar-orientation@usf.edu and the Office of Admissions by submitting an [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/freshmen-forms.aspx). Application Update Forms can take up to two weeks to process.

[Show I don't see any available dates. What do I do?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

While this rarely occurs, it could be due to several reasons. To troubleshoot this
issue, please contact our office at sar-orientation@usf.edu or 941-359-4342. We will work with you to resolve the issue.

[Show How can a family member/guest be added to an Orientation session?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/sarasota-manatee.aspx)

Students may add a family member/guest to attend the Family/Guest Orientation session
by logging back into their Orientation reservation prior to their desired session
date. Log into the student reservation with your NetID and password, scroll to the
section that states “Add a Guest” and pay the additional $50 fee per guest. Once reservations
are closed, a family member/guest may contact the Office of Orientation via email
or phone to be added to the session date.
