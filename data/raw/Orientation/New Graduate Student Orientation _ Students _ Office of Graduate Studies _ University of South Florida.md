## New Graduate Student Orientation

Sponsored by the Office of Graduate Studies for all new students, Orientation brings
together faculty, staff, and current students who will share information and advice
to ease your transition and enrich your graduate experience at USF. Please make every
effort to attend. A flexible schedule is designed to share important information across
several topics.

##### Orientation Canvas Course Information:

All newly admitted graduate students are automatically enrolled into the Graduate
Student Orientation Canvas Course provided by the Office of Graduate Studies. The course was developed to provide new students foundational knowledge and tools needed
to navigate university life and graduate academics with confidence at USF.

Discover helpful welcome videos, guides, and links from key campus services, including
Financial Aid, Health and Wellness Services, Account Services, and more. The course
will remain available throughout the student's first semester. *Note: You may not see the course in Canvas yet. It will populate before in-person
orientation date.*

and engaging, you can choose from a variety of **20-minute sessions** tailored to your interests. Each session is offered multiple times throughout the
event, giving you the flexibility to attend the topics that matter most to you.

The evening concludes with a Resource Fair in the MSC Ballroom, with over 25 departments
and organizations in attendance. Throughout the program, students will also have opportunities
to connect informally with their peers.
