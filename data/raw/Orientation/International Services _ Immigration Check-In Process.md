## Immigration Check-In

**All international students and scholars who are new to USF, or who are arriving to
the  U.S. as a USF student for the first time, are required to attend an Immigration
Check-in upon their arrival to USF**.

---

### What is Immigration Check-In Process?

Immigration Check-in is the process by which an international student advisor checks
that your immigration documents show the correct status, and that your Glo-Bull Start
checklist has been completed correctly. Immigration Check-in is a separate event from
your Undergraduate or Graduate orientation.

### WHEN IS IMMIGRATION CHECK-IN?

Immigration Check-ins are scheduled multiple times a week starting 30 days prior to
each semester. You must check-in by the third week of the semester. You must attend
an Immigration Check-in during the term of your admission or first arrival to the
U.S.

### WHERE IS IMMIGRATION CHECK-IN?

Immigration Check-in is held virtually through [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/).

### **To Sign Up for Immigration Check-In:**

**After you have arrived in the U.S.**, click on the link below to open the Virtual Immigration Check-in Sign-up E-form.
Review the available sessions and make plans to attend a session. You can sign-up
for a session up to 15 minutes before the session start time.

### Immigration Check-In Process Tips:

* Students must complete ALL Post-Arrival E-Forms, except the Local Address E-Form,
  BEFORE attending Immigration Check-In. \*If your E-Forms are not complete you may be
  asked to reschedule.
* Students having trouble completing E-forms should either email globullstart@usf.edu for assistance, or visit the office during walk-in hours.
* The most recent I-20 or DS-2019, I-94, and POE stamp should be uploaded to the appropriate
  E-Forms.
* INTO to USF Change of Level and Transfer students should upload their new USF degree
  seeking I-20.
* Students should enter their local mailing address in Student Self-Service (formerly
  OASIS) as soon as possible, even if it’s a temporary address. This includes a hotel
  address or a friend’s address. The address can be updated.

### **Virtual(MS Teams) Immigration Check-in Tips:**

* We recommend you [download and install the Teams application](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app) on the device you will use during Immigration Check-in. Your device must be capable
  of both audio and video so we can speak to you and see you.
