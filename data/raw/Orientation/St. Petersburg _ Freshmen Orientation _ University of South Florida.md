#### General Questions

[Show Is Orientation mandatory?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/st-petersburg.aspx)

Orientation is a critical component of a successful university experience and facilitates
the smooth transition of students in the academic and social environments of the University.
Because student success is at the heart of all we do here at USF, we require that
every new student complete Orientation. The Orientation program is supported by a
USF policy mandating that new students attend Orientation as a requirement of admission
to the University.

[Show What if I am unable to attend any of the Orientation sessions?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/st-petersburg.aspx)

Orientation is mandatory for all new students at the University of South Florida.
We strongly encourage anyone who has concerns about being able to attend an Orientation
session to email us immediately at OrientationStPete@usf.edu. Additionally, you might consider updating your term of entry to a later term to
allow you to attend a later Orientation. To do this, you would need to contact the
[Office of Admissions](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/contact-us/).

[Show How do I request ADA accommodations to attend Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/st-petersburg.aspx)

Orientation strives to provide the same experience to all participants. In compliance
with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), we provide special accommodations
to students and guests who require this to participate in the session. Requests are
often submitted for assistance with mobility, vision or hearing issues.

Other requests might include special dietary concerns or special arrangements for
religious observances.

If you need any type of accommodation during your session, email OrientationStPete@usf.edu so we can ensure that all your needs are met. Requests should be submitted at least
14 business days prior to your session. In cases of emergency situations, we will
do our best to meet your needs.

offer waivers for the Orientation fee. However, we are happy to charge the amount

fee upfront (see below).

Students choosing this option of payment are fully responsible for the Orientation

#### Family and Guest Orientation

[Show Will families and guests be able to attend with their student?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/st-petersburg.aspx)

College is not just a new journey for students, but for parents and families as well.
USF St. Petersburg offers a supplemental Family and Guest Orientation program that
is designed to answer the myriad of questions surrounding a student’s first time in
college. The success of your student is our top priority. We hope to engage all parents
as partners in the process.

Family and Guest Orientation provides family members an introduction to campus resources
and helpful information to support your student, as well as opportunities to ask questions
and meet others.

We allow two guests per student. One to two parent(s), guardian(s), or other adult
family member(s) may attend. Family and Guest Orientation is limited to these relationships
to students. *The Orientation program and atmosphere are not appropriate for siblings or other guests*.

If you’d like to attend, please make sure your student formally adds you to their
Orientation reservation.

[Show What do additional attendees/guests do during the Orientation session?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/st-petersburg.aspx)

Families and guests will start and end their session with presentations specific to
their role but will be able to attend presentations with their student for the middle
portion of the event. Family members and guests are not permitted to attend the student-only
presentations as we want to start their transition and create an environment where
new students can get to know each other as they learn about campus and how to succeed
at USF’s St. Petersburg campus.

[Show Can a sibling or child be an additional attendee?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/st-petersburg.aspx)

No. Parents, guardians, partners and other adult family members may attend, but the
Orientation session is not appropriate for siblings or other guests.

[Show Why is there an additional fee?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/st-petersburg.aspx)

The Family and Guest Orientation incurs the same costs related to materials, software/technology,
facility rentals, staffing, marketing and more.
