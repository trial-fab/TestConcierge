## Paying Tuition and Fees

### Requirements

You will not receive a formal payment notice, but can review your financial statement
using Student Self-Service (formerly OASIS). Your USF bill is due each semester by
the end of the first week of classes (add/drop week). Failure to pay in full can result
in late charges, a hold on your student account, being dropped from your courses,
and loss of USF services.

* [Sarasota-Manatee Cashier's Office](https://www.sarasotamanatee.usf.edu/campus-life/campus-resources/business-office/index.aspx)

### Flywire

USF has partnered with Flywire to allow secure payments from almost any country and
any bank, typically in your home currency. By making your payment with Flywire, you
can track your payments from start to finish, save on bank fees and exchange rates,
and contact their multilingual customer support team with any questions.

### Sponsored Students - 3rd Party Payments

If your bill is paid by an outside agency, be sure to keep your financial guarantee/support
letter up to date through iStart.
