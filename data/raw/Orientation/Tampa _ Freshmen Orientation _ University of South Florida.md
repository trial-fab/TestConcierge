and build connections prior to the start of your first semester.

### FAQS

#### General Questions

[Show Why is there an Orientation fee?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

New undergraduate students are required to pay a $35 fee to attend Orientation upon
making a reservation. Additional charges may apply for families and guests who choose
to attend Orientation. The fee goes toward covering the costs of providing the full
Orientation experience to students, including facility rentals, meals, staffing and
necessary services and expenses to ensure a successful start. If you’re experiencing
financial difficulties, please contact us at myorientation@usf.edu

[Show What if I am unable to attend any of the Orientation sessions?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

Orientation is mandatory for all new students at the University of South Florida.
We strongly encourage anyone who has concerns about being able to attend an Orientation
session to call us immediately at 813-974-3060. Additionally, you might consider updating your term of entry to a later term to
allow you to attend a later orientation. To do this, you would need to contact the
Office of Undergraduate Admissions at 813-974-3350.

[Show How do I request ADA accommodations to attend Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

Orientation strives to provide the same experience to all participants. In compliance
with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), we provide special accommodations
to students and guests who require this to participate in the session. Requests are
often submitted for assistance with mobility, vision or hearing issues.

Other requests might include special dietary concerns or special arrangements for
religious observances.

[Service or Assistance Animal Policy](https://usf.box.com/s/i5yvmd3nyihqx02kpq9l4cs45fyejusv "USF Animal On Campus Policy")

If you need any type of accommodation during your session, please call our office
at 813-974-3060 so we can ensure that all your needs are met. Requests should be submitted at least
seven business days prior to your session. In cases of emergency situations, we will
do our best to meet your needs.

Students requiring accommodations should also contact Students with Disabilities Services
at 813-974-4309 for accommodations needed once classes begin.

[Show Is there a Family and Guest Orientation program?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

Families and guests of incoming first-year students will be given the option to attend
a supplemental Family and Guest Orientation experience. Like the student Orientation
experience, the family and guest experience will include access to an Orientation
session with campus leadership. The family and guest Orientation program is only offered
for in-person on-campus Orientation sessions.

[Show What should I bring to Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

* A pen (for notetaking)
* A sweater or jacket (the A/C can get cold)
* An umbrella (Florida weather can be unpredictable!)
* A snack or two (but don’t worry, we will provide you with meals!)

#### First-Year Students

[Show Can I stay in a residence hall the night before my Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

The Office of Orientation does not provide overnight accommodations.

#### Payments

[Show Can I pay for Orientation with check or money order?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

While we prefer that you pay for your Orientation with a credit card or e-Check, we
can accept checks or money orders. Student reservations are not confirmed until payment
is received, so please note that this method will delay your confirmation.

To pay with a check or money order, please log into your [Orientation reservation](https://secure.vzorientation.com/usf/signin.aspx) and complete the reservation process up to the point of submitting payment. Then,
complete the [Cashier Payment Form](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/documents/cashiers-form_2020-v4.pdf) and mail it to the address listed on the form. You should also then email myorientation@usf.edu to let us know that you submitted payment. We will need to manually confirm your
reservation.

[Show Can I charge my Orientation fee to my student account?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

Students choosing this option of payment are fully responsible for the Orientation
fees.
Financial aid may or may not cover these charges. By submitting [this form](https://form.jotform.com/92815011621144), the student agrees to pay Orientation fees within other University tuition and fee
deadlines.

At this time guest fees will not be charged to a student’s account. Guests may pay
for Orientation at any time including check-in (if space is available).

[Show Is it possible to obtain a refund for an Orientation session?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

Refunds are available only in specific situations. Click [here](https://usfweb.usf.edu/orientation/refundrequest.aspx) to request a refund. For more information, contact our office.

#### Preparing for Orientation Day

[Show How do I print my Orientation parking permit?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

During the reservation process, you were given the opportunity for a parking permit
for each student and guest. The parking permit will be included in your e-confirmation
packet. If you do not have your e-confirmation packet, log back into your MyOrientation
account and download the PDF from the My Reservation tab.

***Please note:** Your parking permit can only be found in your reservation for Orientation so please
make sure to log back into your Orientation account to access the permit.*

If you did not receive a parking permit in your e-confirmation packet, you can log
into your Orientation reservation and request a permit under the Student tab or for
a guest under the Guests tab.

[Show Do I have to bring my unofficial transcripts with me to Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

Knowing the specific classes you have taken and/or being able to provide an expected
AP/IB score will assist in choosing the right classes. To support this, we encourage
you to bring your unofficial transcripts with you to Orientation to assist you with
your course registration. However, this is not required. An unofficial transcript
can be a document from your high school/college or something you print from your school’s
online site.

Bringing unofficial transcripts is especially important for students starting in the
summer when final transcripts are not yet available. Your academic advisor will work
with you if your final transcripts or scores later indicate a change that impacts
your pre-requisites.

#### Reservation Information

[Show How do I change information on my Orientation reservation or choose another date?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

You can make changes to your reservation details and/or add guests by logging into
your MyOrientation account. Refunds are not issued for students or guests who do not
show up to their scheduled sessions. Further, reservations changed within three business
days of a session or due to "no show" status may be subject to a $25 late/no show
fee.

[Show Can I change my major before I attend Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

To change your major, you must submit an [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/freshmen-forms.aspx) in your Applicant Portal.

**Please note:** Many academic programs at USF are limited-access majors that require very specific
courses and credits in order to be admitted to these majors. We strongly recommend
that you speak with an admissions recruiter prior to submitting the [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/freshmen-forms.aspx).

[Show I am admitted to USF but will not be attending this semester. Who do I contact?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

You should notify both the Office of Orientation by calling 813-974-3060 and the Office of Admissions by submitting an [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/freshmen-forms.aspx). Application Update Forms can take up to four weeks to process.

[Show I don't see any available dates. What do I do?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

While this rarely occurs, it could be due to several reasons. To troubleshoot this
issue, please contact our office at myorientation@usf.edu or 813-974-3060. We will work with you to resolve the issue.

[Show How can a family member or guest be added to an Orientation session?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

Students may add a family member or guest to attend the Family and Guest Orientation
session by logging back into their Orientation reservation by 10 a.m. on their desired
session date. Log into the student reservation with your NetID and password, scroll
to the section that states “Add a Guest” and pay the additional $50 fee per guest.
Once reservations are closed, a family member or guest may contact the Office of Orientation
via email or phone to be added to the session date.

#### Special Populations

[Show I’m an SSS Program participant. What do I need to know about Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

If you’ve been accepted into the Student Support Services (SSS) program, you will
be required to reserve a date through your Orientation account; however, the fee for
Orientation will be billed directly to your student account. Payment is not required
at the time of student reservation.

Students who have received information indicating they are eligible or admitted to
this
program should contact SSS staff directly at Student Support Services, UGS AskSSS@usf.edu or 813-974-4301.

[Show I’m a student athlete. What do I need to know about Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ftic/tampa.aspx)

As a student athlete on scholarship through USF Athletics, your Orientation fees are
billed to your student account. Any questions about the fee can be directed to USF
Orientation or USF Athletics. When making your reservation, complete all required
information and click Submit at the last step. If family members will be attending
with you, there is an additional fee for each family member. Please add any additional
family members to your reservation after completing the student reservation. This
ensures that the student fees will be billed to the student account, while any family
fees must be paid prior to attendance at a session.

USF Athletics AEC staff will coordinate your attendance at Orientation around your
practices and other obligations. Attendance at an Orientation session is required
by USF before starting classes.
