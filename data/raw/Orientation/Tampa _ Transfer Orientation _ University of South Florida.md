### Welcome

Welcome to the University of South Florida, a leading transfer student destination
in the state of Florida!

Whether you are transferring from a local community college or a four-year institution,
you’ll find that USF can help you take your education to the next level.

Our highly interactive Transfer Orientation sessions — delivered in an in-person or
virtual discussion-based format — are designed specifically for the transfer student
population at USF. You’ll learn about the broad range of opportunities available to
students at our global research university and how you can make the most of a full
university experience. Because we know you’ve already completed some college courses,
we’ve incorporated feedback from current USF transfer students to build a program
that will better suit your unique needs.

You’ll also engage with a group of other incoming undergraduate students and receive
important USF information best delivered in an in person and virtual discussion-based
format.

### faqs

Please review this section to find answers to our most commonly asked questions.

#### General Questions

[Show Why is there an Orientation fee?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

New undergraduate students are required to pay a $35 fee to attend Orientation upon
making a reservation. Additional charges may apply for families and guests who choose
to attend Orientation. The fee goes toward covering the costs of providing the full
Orientation experience to students, including facility rentals, meals, staffing and
necessary services and expenses to ensure a successful start. If you’re experiencing
financial difficulties, please contact us at myorientation@usf.edu.

[Show What if I am unable to attend any of the Orientation sessions?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

Orientation is mandatory for all new students at the University of South Florida.
We strongly encourage anyone who has concerns about being able to attend an Orientation
session to call us immediately at 813-974-3060. Additionally, you might consider updating your term of entry to a later term to
allow you to attend a later orientation. To do this, you would need to contact the
Office of Undergraduate Admissions at 813-974-3350.

[Show How do I request ADA accommodations to attend Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

Orientation strives to provide the same experience to all participants. In compliance
with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), we provide special accommodations
to students and guests who require this to participate in the session. Requests are
often submitted for assistance with mobility, vision or hearing issues.

Other requests might include special dietary concerns or special arrangements for
religious observances.

If you need any type of accommodation during your session, please call our office
at 813-974-3060 so we can ensure that all your needs are met. Requests should be submitted at least
seven business days prior to your session. In cases of emergency situations, we will
do our best to meet your needs.

Students requiring accommodations should also contact Students with Disabilities Services
at 813 974-4309 for accommodations needed once classes begin.

#### Reservation Information

[Show How do I change information on my Orientation reservation or choose another date?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

You can make changes to your reservation details and/or add guests by logging into
your MyOrientation account. Refunds are not issued for students or guests who do not
show up to their scheduled sessions. Further, reservations changed within three business
days of a session or due to “no show” status may be subject to a $25 late/no show
fee.

[Show Can I change my major before I attend Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

To change your major, you must submit an [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/transfer/next-steps/transfer-forms.aspx) in your Applicant Portal.

**Please note:** Many academic programs at USF are limited-access majors that require very specific
courses and credits in order to be admitted to these majors. We strongly recommend
that you speak with an admissions recruiter prior to submitting the [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/transfer/next-steps/transfer-forms.aspx).

[Show I am admitted to USF but will not be attending this semester. Who do I contact?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

You should notify both the Office of Orientation by calling 813-974-3060 and the Office of Admissions by submitting an [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/transfer/next-steps/transfer-forms.aspx). Application Update Forms can take up to two weeks to process.

[Show I don’t see any available dates. What do I do?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

While this rarely occurs, it could be due to several reasons. To troubleshoot this
issue, please contact our office at myorientation@usf.edu or 813 974-3060. We will work with you to resolve the issue.

[Show How can a family member or guest be added to an Orientation session?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

Students may add a family member or guest to attend the Family and Guest Orientation
session by logging back into their Orientation reservation by 10 a.m. on their desired
session date. Log into the student reservation with your NetID and password, scroll
to the section that states “Add a Guest” and pay the additional $35 fee per guest.
Once reservations are closed, a family member or guest may contact the Office of Orientation
via email or phone to be added to the session date.

#### Payments

[Show Can I pay for Orientation with check or money order?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

While we prefer that you pay for your Orientation with a credit card or e-Check, we
can accept checks or money orders. Student reservations are not confirmed until payment
is received, so please note that this method will delay your confirmation.

To pay with a check or money order, please log into your [Orientation reservation](https://secure.vzorientation.com/usf/signin.aspx) and complete the reservation process up to the point of submitting payment. Then,
complete the [Cashier Payment Form](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/documents/cashiers-form_2020-v4.pdf) and mail it to the address listed on the form. You should also then email myorientation@usf.edu to let us know that you submitted payment. We will need to manually confirm your
reservation.

[Show Can I charge my Orientation fee to my student account?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

Students choosing this option of payment are fully responsible for the Orientation
fees. Financial aid may or may not cover these charges. By submitting [this form](https://form.jotform.com/92815011621144), the student agrees to pay Orientation fees within other University tuition and fee
deadlines.

At this time, guest fees will not be charged to a student’s account. Guests may register
and pay for Orientation at any time including check-in (if space is available).

[Show Is it possible to obtain a refund for an Orientation session?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

Refunds are available only in specific situations. Click [here](https://usfweb.usf.edu/orientation/refundrequest.aspx) to request a refund. For more information, contact our office.

#### Preparing for Orientation Day

[Show How do I print my Orientation parking permit?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

During the reservation process, you were given the opportunity for a parking permit
for each student and guest. The parking permit will be included in your e-confirmation
packet. If you do not have your e-confirmation packet, log back into your MyOrientation
account and download the PDF from the My Reservation tab.

***Please note**: Your parking permit can only be found in your reservation for Orientation so make
sure to log back into your Orientation account to access the permit.*

If you did not receive a parking permit in your e-confirmation packet, you can log
into your Orientation reservation and request a permit under the Student tab or for
a guest under the Guests tab.

[Show Do I have to bring my unofficial transcripts with me to Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

Knowing the specific classes you’ve taken and/or being able to provide an expected
AP/IB score will assist in choosing the right classes. To support this, we encourage
you to bring your unofficial transcripts with you to Orientation to assist you with
your course registration. However, this is not required. An unofficial transcript
can be a document from your high school/college or something you print from your school’s
online site.

Bringing unofficial transcripts is especially important for students starting in the
summer when final transcripts are not yet available. Your academic advisor will work
with you if your final transcripts or scores later indicate a change that impacts
your pre-requisites.

[Show What technology is needed to participate in the Orientation sessions?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

To ensure you have a seamless virtual session day, please be sure that you have access
to:

* USF NetID and Password
* Reliable Internet Connection
* Laptop or Desktop Computer
* Webcam and Microphone
* Access to Microsoft Teams using USF credentials

If you cannot access any of these required items, please contact the Office of Orientation
immediately by emailing us at myorientation@usf.edu.

#### Transfer Students

[Show I am a former USF student, returning to USF. Do I need to attend Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

As a former student returning to USF, you are not required to attend Orientation.
However, you must set up an appointment with your [academic advisor](https://usf.appiancloud.com/suite/sites/archivum/page/archivum/report/daQEig) in order to register for classes.

Also, be sure to check with Student Health Services as you may need to meet new immunization
requirements.

If you would like to attend Orientation, you can reserve your seat via myBullsPath.

[Show I am seeking a second baccalaureate. Do I need to attend Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

Students seeking their second bachelor’s degree must attend a Transfer Orientation.

Second Baccalaureate students who received their first bachelor’s degree from USF
are not required to attend Orientation but must contact [Academic Advising](https://usf.appiancloud.com/suite/sites/archivum/page/archivum/report/daQEig) to set up an advising appointment in order to register for classes.

If you would like to attend Orientation, you can reserve your seat via myBullsPath.

[Show When will I receive academic advising?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

All transfer students who receive confirmation they have been admitted to USF and
have registered for their USF Orientation will receive an email from their academic
advisor informing them of the action to take to receive advising and register for
classes. You can anticipate receiving the email from your advisor within 15 business
days after registering for your USF orientation. Please check your USF email and be
sure to follow the instructions from your advisor.

[Show When should I make an appointment to see my academic advisor?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

After you are admitted to USF and registered for your USF Orientation, you will receive
an email from your advisor. Within the email, your advisor will prompt you to make
an advising appointment via Archivum. If you are able to make an advising appointment
prior to the date of your USF Orientation, this will be referred to as “preadvising.”
Once you complete your USF Orientation and receive preadvising or advising, you can
register for classes.

[Show How do I make an appointment to meet with my academic advisor so I can register for
classes?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

You can make an advising appointment using the online appointment scheduling system
known as [Archivum](https://usf.appiancloud.com/suite/sites/archivum/page/archivum/report/Ly9e-g).

[Show What if I want to change my major before classes start?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

If you decide to change your major, you should contact both the advising office of
the new major and your current major to seek guidance on whether you are eligible
for the new major and how to complete the change of major process. General contact
information on advising in each college can be found on the Undergraduate Studies
[advising website](https://www.usf.edu/undergrad/students/advising-offices.aspx).

[Show What if I haven’t heard from an advisor?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

After you register for your university Orientation, you will receive an email from
your advisor to your USF account. You can anticipate receiving the email from your
advisor within 15 business days of registering for Orientation. If you find you have
not received an email from your advisor after 15 business days of registering for
your university Orientation, you are welcome to contact the Office of Orientation
at myorientation@usf.edu or by phone at 813-974-3060.

[Show Can I make an advising appointment on my own?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

The advising community recognizes new students are eager to connect with their advisor,
so we will reach out to you!  After you register for your university Orientation,
your advisor will begin preparing for your upcoming university orientation date. As
part of that preparation, your advisor will email you within 15 business days after
you register for Orientation. Be sure to check your USF email for an email from your
advisor!

If you still wish to make an advising appointment, you can do so using [Archivum](https://usf.appiancloud.com/suite/sites/archivum/page/archivum/report/Ly9e-g). If you have technical difficulties with Archivum, please contact the IT helpdesk
at help@usf.edu.

[Show I’ve tried to make an appointment, but I don't have access to Archivum. What should
I do?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

If you have technical difficulties with Archivum, please contact the IT helpdesk at
help@usf.edu.

[Show I applied and was admitted for summer, but I would like to start in the fall semester
instead. What should I do to update my admission for the subsequent term?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

You will need to complete an [application update form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/transfer/next-steps/transfer-forms.aspx) and send it directly to admissions@usf.edu. The update form must be received by the admissions deadline for the semester. The
form takes four to six weeks to process. Students who fail to register for the semester
in which they were admitted will have their admissions canceled. This also applies
if you want to change the major you had initially indicated on your application form.

[Show What should I do if my admission is canceled for nonenrollment?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)

Students who do not register for classes for the term in which they’ve been admitted
will have their admission canceled. Use the [Application Update Form](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/transfer/next-steps/transfer-forms.aspx) when requesting changes to your original application information, such as term of
entry, major or campus, or when submitting changes in contact information. Be sure
to submit this form by the application deadline of the term in which you wish to enroll.

[Show I have a hold on my records for immunization. Who do I talk to about this?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/tampa.aspx)
