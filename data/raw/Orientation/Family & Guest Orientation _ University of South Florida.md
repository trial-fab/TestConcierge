# Family and Guests Orientation

Welcome to the Bulls Family!

College isn’t just an exciting new journey for students — it’s a time of change for
parents and families as well. Whether your student is entering college for the first
time, traveling to USF as an international student or transferring from another institution,
you will play a vital role in supporting them. That’s why USF offers a supplemental
Family & Guests Orientation program to answer your questions and welcome you to the
Bulls family!

**Although Orientation is only required for students, not family members, we highly
recommend you attend.** Orientation provides valuable information to help you navigate your student’s transition
to USF. We can't wait to meet you!

We also encourage you to review our OneUSF [Bull Family Connect](https://www.collegiateparent.com/bull-family-connect/) guide and take advantage of our [Parent & Family Experience website](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/parents/).

## How to Engage With Us:

### 1. In-Person, On-Campus Orientation Program

During your scheduled Orientation session, you’ll join the Orientation Team and other
USF Campus Partners for a full-day event on all things USF. Campus Partners and Orientation
Leaders will guide you throughout the day, providing key university information and
ways for you to support your student during their transition to USF. Please check
back for more information regarding the schedule for the day.

If you are unable to make it to your student’s Orientation date but still want to
stay in the loop of what's happening at USF, we encourage you to sign up for USF’s
family bulletin through CampusESP.

## Reserve Your Orientation Spot

When your student reserves an Orientation session, they should indicate any guests
that will be attending.

Once your student registers you as their guest for Orientation, an e-confirmation
packet will be added to their MyOrientation reservation. The student and guest e-confirmation
packets can be downloaded and printed by logging into the MyOrientation reservation
system using the student’s NetID.

## Frequently Asked Questions

[Show Why are the family and guest and student programs separate?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/family/)

Families and guests will attend portions of the program with their student, while
some portions are tailored to the needs of families and guests in support of both
their student’s transition as well as their own. Students and families learn information
differently; therefore, it is important to make sure that our information gets across
to both students and families most effectively.

We want our students to spend time getting to know their fellow Bulls. We are confident
that this model provides everyone with the most accurate and relevant information,
while supporting their individual needs.

[Show Why is there a fee involved?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/family/)

This fee helps us to cover the costs associated with managing Orientation including
space, staff, meals and supplies.

[Show What should I bring to Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/family/)

A pen is always useful, as there will be tons of information you’ll be jotting down.
We recommend that you bring a sweater or jacket, as our indoor meeting locations can
be cool. Florida weather can be unpredictable, so it is always a good idea to bring
an umbrella. We will provide you with meals, but in case you get hungry in between
sessions, you may want to bring a snack or two.

Be sure to print your parking permit and any additional materials that you may need.

***Please note:** Parking permits are included in the reservation confirmation. Students must log back
into their [myOrientation reservation](https://secure.vzorientation.com/usf/signin.aspx) in order to access their confirmation page and print their parking permit.*

[Show Does USF provide overnight accommodations for Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/family/)

Overnight accommodations are not available for the USF Orientation experience.

[Show Where can I get more information?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/family/)

Once your student registers you as their guest for Orientation, an e-confirmation
packet will be added to their MyOrientation reservation. The student and guest e-confirmation
packets can be downloaded/printed by logging back into the MyOrientation reservation
system using the student’s NetID. Be sure to keep an eye on your email, as we will
be sending you additional information prior to your Orientation session via email.
Please contact us if you have questions in the meantime.

[Show Sounds great! How do I sign up?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/family/)

Your student can add you to their Orientation registration by logging into [VZOrientation](https://secure.vzorientation.com/usf/signin.aspx) with their NetID and password.
