## Overview

#### Welcome!

We are looking forward to meeting you. Our office is here to assist you with your
entry to the US in the proper immigration status, completing your immigration check-in
process, and communicate other university requirements.

#### Plan Your Arrival

Please note that new F-1 and J-1 students can enter the U.S. no more than 30 days
prior to the program start date listed on their I-20 or DS-2019. Make sure to coordinate
your travel plans to accommodate your orientation schedule, including any department
orientations you plan to attend.

* [Undergraduate Orientation](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/ "Undergraduate Orientation")
* [Graduate Orientation](https://www.usf.edu/graduate-studies/students/newly-admitted-students/orientation/index.aspx "Graduate Orientation")
* [INTO USF Orientation](https://www.usf.edu/archive/intousf/arriving/intousforientation.aspx "INTO USF Orientation")

#### Travel Documents

You should bring your passport with visa stamp, I-20 or DS-2019, proof of SEVIS fee
payment (I-901), and other supporting documentation in your carry-on luggage when
traveling to the US.

#### What to Expect at the US Port of Entry

Once you arrive at the US Port of Entry you will apply for entry to the US from the
Customs and Border Protection officer. Be prepared to show your visa, I-20, passport,
and supporting documentation.

#### Check Your Status

Once granted entry to the US, you should receive a blue and red Port of Entry Stamp
in your passport. It indicates date of arrival, immigration status (F-1 or J-1), and
duration of time for which you are admitted to the US.

Port of Entry stamps for F-1 and J-1 students should indicate ‘D/S’. This refers to
the “duration of status” that is needed to complete your academic program. If the
officer puts a specific end date for the duration, please see our office so we can
assist you in correcting this error.

For more information about the arrival process see the US Department of Homeland Security’s
website, [Study in the States.](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/)

For current government guidelines see the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's
website, [How to Navigate the U.S. Immigration System](https://www.ice.gov/sevis/students).
