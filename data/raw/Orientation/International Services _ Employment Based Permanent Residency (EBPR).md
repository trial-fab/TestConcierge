## Employment Based Permanent Residency (EBPR)

OIS works with the University designated attorney to assist departments to sponsor
to provide sponsorship of permanent residency based on USF employment for qualitied
USF positions.  Cases should not be started until the employee is fully employed at
USF and in a non-immigrant visa classification that includes dual intent such as H-1B
or O-1.

The three categories used by USF are listed below with eligibility factors:

[Show EB1B: Outstanding Researcher/Professor](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-services/employees/permanent-residency.aspx)

USF Position must be tenured, tenure track or officially tenure equivalent. Ex. Assistant
Professor, Associate Professor. This category is based on the previous search for
employment and requires the employee to prove that they have made “original contributions
to the field’ and that they are recognized by their peers as outstanding. This category
does not require the department to pay for legal or filing fees.

[Show EB2: Special Handling for University Teachers](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-services/employees/permanent-residency.aspx)

Position must include majority teaching duties. This category can use a previous national
search if the offer letter was signed less than 18 months from filing and the advertisement
was posted in an online journal viewable by the public for at least 30 days. Otherwise,
the process will include a new national employment search that would meet USF and
category guidelines. This category requires the department to pay for legal fees for
the labor certification process.   The employee may pay other fees.

[Show EB2: Advanced Degree Professionals](https://www.usf.edu/world/international-services/employees/permanent-residency.aspx)

Position must have official minimum requirements equivalent to Master’s Degree. Please
include job description showing minimum requirements as approved by USF Central HR.
 This category requires a local search with specific parameters to demonstrate that
no US candidates are available at the minimum requirements. This category requires
the department to pay for legal fees for the labor certification process. The employee
may pay other fees.

### Costs

EBPR cases incur USCIS filings fees and legal fees based on the type of case.  USF
departments can review the current fee schedule at the following Box link [Employee Sponsorship Fee Schedule](https://usf.box.com/s/jpt51cu1l4vzyqen3ofh2rke96xgq9kq).

Each college has different policies and practices for who pays for an application.
For any EB2 filing, the department must pay the costs for the first stage.  After
that departments may pay all remaining costs, split the remaining costs, or have the
employee pay the remaining costs.

### Quick Start instructions

**Step 1** – Get Department permission to iStart (if you already have this move to step 2)
**Step 2** – The employee should have an USF U# and you can go to Step 3. If they do not, get
the employee’s full name, date of birth, gender, and email (not from 125.com, 126.com)
to complete the Add New Person eform.
**Step 3** – Complete EBPR eforms

### Complete Instructions

**The Employment Based Permanent Residency (EBPR) process is on online processing initiated
by the USF hiring department.**

1. Determine who the ‘department contact’ will be. The department contact is the person
   who will be responsible for logging into iStart and going through the online EBVS/PR
   process. It might be a department administrator or the hiring supervisor.  Remember
   that the department contact will also work with USF’s Designated Counsel (law firm).
2. The department contact will log in. We suggest creating a bookmark in your browser.
3. If it is the first time the department contact has logged in, they will fill out the
   Department Permission Request Form and then email INTLEmployee@usf.edu  to let us know they have applied.
4. Once we approve their permission, the department contact should log back in and begin
   the application process.
5. The employee should already exist in iStart and you should not need to add a new person.
6. If approved, the department will continue to complete these eforms:
7. Permanent Residency Request – the department will provide the employee’s full name,
   the official position name, upload the position description, and answer questions
   necessary to initiate the case.
8. Final Approval Signatures – the employee’s supervisor, department head, and Dean/VP,
   will be required to sign off on the request. All signatories must be USF employees
   as listed in USF’s HR database and have the ability to sign into the eforms using
   their USF Net ID. Requests from USF Health are forwarded to the appropriate USF Health
   Vice President.
9. Once all parties have signed, the request will be reviewed by OIS.
10. Once the request is approved, OIS will email the law firm to initiate the case.
