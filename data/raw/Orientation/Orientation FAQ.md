all colleges. **Take the opportunity to meet students while attending various social, professional
development, and academic-based sessions.**

Should your program offer their own orientation, please inquire directly with the

[Show Canvas course vs. In-Person Orientation?](https://www.usf.edu/graduate-studies/students/newly-admitted-students/orientation/orientation-faq.aspx)

The Canvas course was developed by OGS for all graduate students, it is a resource
that will remain in your Canvas account for at least your first semester. *You are automatically placed into the group, and will be automatically removed.*

The Canvas course is a hub of information that is important to all graduate students,
regardless of their program! *Revisit the course for helpful links and videos about Financial Aid, Health and Wellness
Services, Student Account Services, and Graduate Studies information.*
