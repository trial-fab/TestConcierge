#### General

[Show Is Orientation mandatory?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/st-petersburg.aspx)

Orientation is a critical component of a successful university experience and facilitates
the smooth transition of students in the academic and social environments of the University.
Because student success is at the heart of all we do here at USF, we require that
every new student complete Orientation. The Orientation program is supported by a
USF policy mandating that new students attend Orientation as a requirement of admission
to the University.

[Show What if I am unable to attend any of the Orientation sessions?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/st-petersburg.aspx)

Orientation is mandatory for all new students at the University of South Florida.
We strongly encourage anyone who has concerns about being able to attend an Orientation
session to email us immediately at OrientationStPete@usf.edu. Additionally, you might consider updating your term of entry to a later term to
allow you to attend a later Orientation. To do this, you would need to contact the
[Office of Admissions](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/contact-us/).

[Show What if I cannot afford the Orientation fee?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/st-petersburg.aspx)

Because the Orientation fee covers the cost of the Orientation, we are not able to
offer waivers for the Orientation fee. However, we are happy to charge the amount

upfront (see below).

#### Family and Guest Orientation

[Show Will families and guests be able to attend with their student?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/st-petersburg.aspx)

College is not just a new journey for students but for parents and families as well.
USF’s St. Petersburg campus offers a supplemental Family and Guest Orientation program
that is designed to answer the myriad of questions surrounding a student’s first time
in college. The success of your student is our top priority. We hope to engage all
parents as partners in the process.

Family and Guest Orientation provides family members an introduction to campus resources
and helpful information to support your student, as well as opportunities to ask questions
and meet others.

We allow two guests per student. One to two parent(s), guardian(s), or other adult
family member(s) may attend. Family and Guest Orientation is limited to these relationships
to students. The Orientation program and atmosphere are not appropriate for siblings
or other guests.

If you’d like to attend, please make sure your student formally adds you to their
Orientation reservation.

Please note that participation in the virtual Family and Guest Orientation Session
therefore requires an additional device.

[Show What do family members and guests do during the Orientation session?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/st-petersburg.aspx)

Families and guests will start and end their session with presentations specific to
their roles but will be able to attend presentations with their student for the middle
portion of the event. Family members and guests are not permitted to attend the student-only
presentations as we want to start their transition and create an environment where
new students can get to know each other as they learn about campus and how to succeed
at USF’s St. Petersburg campus.

[Show Can a sibling or child be an additional attendee?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/st-petersburg.aspx)

No. Parents, guardians or partners and other adult family members may attend, but
the Orientation session is not appropriate for siblings or other guests.

[Show Why is there an additional fee?](https://www.usf.edu/orientation/transfer/st-petersburg.aspx)

The Family and Guest Orientation incurs the same costs related to materials, software/technology,
facility rentals, staffing, marketing and more.
